      " 412 ounce bottle into weizen glass bottled on 5/17/2016. Pours hazy golden/straw color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with great retention that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of lemon banana orange peel peppercorn clove pear apple light bubblegum wheat cracker lightly toasted bread herbal grass and yeast earthiness. Nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast citrus/earthy hops and moderate pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon banana orange peel peppercorn clove pear apple light bubblegum wheat cracker lightly toasted bread herbal grass and yeast earthiness. Light herbal bitterness and yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon banana orange peel peppercorn clove wheat cracker lightly toasted bread herbal grass and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity robustness and balance of fruity/spicy yeast citrus/earthy hops and moderate pale malt flavors; with a great malt/bitter/spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light dryness from bitter/spiciness lightly increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth moderately bready/grainy/creamy and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4.9%. Overall this is a nice hefeweizen. All around good complexity robustness and balance of fruity/spicy yeast citrus/earthy hops and moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth and refreshing to drink. Very well balanced and nicely flavorful; never feeling bland/watery for the low ABV. Pretty classic feeling style flavors. A nicely enjoyable offering. 1826 characters superspak \n",

      " 3.25355ml bottle poured into a weizen glass.Cloudy pale gold straw color the pour forms up one and a half finger of frothy white head that stays for a while with decent retention then dissipates to some bubble sheet on the surface. There is not much of lace to speak with.The aroma is rather faint that is led by citrus floral as well as some clove spice wheat grain earthy grassy bready malt and only ghost-like banana in kind of artificial not that real banana.The taste is surprisingly not that fruity or bubblegum as it should be with only some citrus lime and clove spice. Hop with a bold touch of earthiness grassiness and bitterness while malt is also there with its breadiness and subtle sweet caramel.Light body with some crisp and moderate lively carbonation semi-smooth mouthfeel with some refreshing touch through the palate finish is dry.Forget about the German Hefe before trying this one it is not that bad but nothing worth to repeat. 971 characters Everydayoff \n",

      " 3.25Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a Shaker pint glass there is no \"best by\" date that I can find.APPEARANCE:pours a dense hazy straw color with one-finger white head that slowly dissipated until a thin unbroken layer of small bubbles remained there is significant lacing on the glass and medium carbonation (I think?).SMELL: very faint to the nose bread and faint banana and lemon citrus note.TASTE:initially sweet bread and lemon citrus then faint banana everything understated.PALATE:medium body and carbonation.OVERALL:this is an underwhelming example of a style I truly enjoy it was a great looking beer but smell and taste were very faint I would not buy this one again as there are better options available. 742 characters HoppyBastard \n",

      " 3.5Curious this one. Had it twice. Still can't place it. Maybe because it is almost creates a new style: the American Hefe.Widmer's is the second most rated American-made Hefe (and sixth overall including the Germans) but you have to go down to the 17th hefe to find one with a lower rating than Widmer's.I gave it points because I like the Widmer Bros rags-to-riches rendition for craft brewers; starting in the late 1970s as home-brewers who made a cash cow (their Hefe) who as I understand it made riches; having been bought by a larger company envious of their large following.Listed on the \"1001\" beers it obviously is an arguable inclusion. But Michael Jackson set the tone.MJ's 1999 edition gave it 3 of 4 stars with this telling review \"Widmers Hefe enjoyed great success with its (intentionally) densely sedimented Hefe which tastes somewhere between a beer and a fresh sweetish grapefruit juice but deserves points for that distinction.\" 956 characters Beginner2 \n",

      " 4.25Pours a beautiful hazy golden orange with lots of bubbles and some particles floating about. Small foamy white head that dropped down fairly quickly but still left about a half a finger of head.Smell is deliciously cleanbready smell with notes of wheat through out.Taste is very clean with a spicy note hitting the middle of the tongue with a crisp somewhat wet finish.Mouth feel is pretty light with the carbonation adding some nice tingle as the beer goes down. This beer just seems so underrated with a BA score of 75 and The Bros with 80 at the time I am doing my review. This beer ranks right up towards the top of my all time favorites. An easy drinking tasty and refreshing beer that is so consistent with it's wonderful flavor. 746 characters BeerBobber \n",

      " 3.512 oz. bottle no bottled on date present.Acquired a single bottle of this stuff from a friend via trade. My second beer from Widmer Brothers Brewing Co.Poured into a Duvel tulip glass.A - It pours a cloudy golden body with lots of dark flecks of sediment.Less than a finger of quickly fading bubbly off-white head.No real lacing to speak of.Looks nice.S - A somewhat restrained aroma - lots of bready yeast presence spritzy carb and some fruit presence but not necessarily what I would describe as citrusy. More of a nectary banana - pineapple aroma.Not what I would describe as spicy with no hint of cloves which is to my liking but not necessarily to style.T - Taste is the same - the crisp bready yeast is apparent with notes of fruit in the shape of bananas and pineapples. Some crisp creamy almost cidery notes reside at times.Doesn't always taste very Belgian in nature.M - Smooth crisp & creamy.Light-bodied and easy-drinking with good carb.Overall an average at best offering from Widmer Brothers not exactly very hefe in nature if I didn't know any better I might just think of it as a regular American pale wheat ale.

      " 3.75Cloudy and orange/gold/yellow with visible yet tiny bits of hop/wheat floating about. One of the murkier beers I've had.Almost no head on pouring from a 12oz bottle in a tilted glass but steady flow of CO2. Smells almost earthy which is probably how I'm interpreting the grassiness along with an obvious presence of citrus. Not catching the \"banana\" myself.Aroma is malt/wheaty as is the taste. Citrus flavor is such that I feel a lemon garnish would be unnecessary but never hurts.Good summer beer on a hot day.Probably won't go out of my way for it in the future but drinkable and pleasant enough. 614 characters Nichol \n",

Minimal amounts of lacing are observed.S: Light to moderate aromas of wheat malts and citrus/lemon with a light aroma of grassy + herbal hops.T: Upfront there is a light to moderate flavor of wheat and bready malts with a hint of sweetness. That is followed by light flavors of lemon citrus and a light flavor of grassy + herbal hops which imparts a light amount of lingering bitterness.M: Light bodied with slightly more than moderate amounts of carbonation.

      " 1.75Definitely a wheat beer but to call this a Hefeweizen--unless the 6 pack I had was a bad batch--is misleading. None of the banana or clove notes found in say Sierra Nevada's Kellerweis or Weihenstephaner hefe. The head is a nice cloudy white with some lacing that hangs around for awhile. Mouthfeel is somewhat effervescent and refreshing but lacking compared to nearly every one of the beers I've familiarized myself with representing this style. The beer appears cloudy and has the typical yeast settled at the bottom of the bottles. Flavor is extremely hop forward reminding me of a Belgian IPA. IBUs are listed at 30 which I would need to investigate in order to compare to other hefeweizens. I know the brewery markets this as an American hefe...could this account for the atypical bitterness? I don't taste any fruity notes and outside of appearance the wheat backbone of a typical Hefeweizen is absent. I would not buy again other than if I could get a single bottle or on draft to see if my six-pack happened to be a bad one. Certainly unique but not in a good way. 1084 characters NeubTube \n",

Taste is uneven the fruit coming and going quickly leaving the wheat dominating the flavor for most of the swallow. Mouth feel is quite thin and watery which doesn't do much to make the flavors stick which might be why they feel so off to me. 372 characters vladdswrath \n",

Aroma:Nice aromas of toasted wheat and orange citrus honey as well as some subtle aromas of spices such as coriander black pepper saffron and ginger.Taste:Delicious!Strong flavors of toasted wheat and malt barley up front followed by lots of honey-like sweetness and lemon and orange-like citrus.There are also lots of spice flavors such as black pepper coriander saffron a touch of ginger and finally a touch of grassy piney hops.Mouthfeel:Medium-bodied and very smooth as there is no carbonation what-so-ever.With an ABV of 4.9% there is no alcohol on the palate.Overall:What a delicious beer!And so surprising!I was expecting a traditional hefewiezen beer redolent with aromas and flavors of banana bubblegum and band-aids (which are usually the reasons I don’t like most hefeweizens) yet this hefeweizen beer has none of those.It tastes much more like a Belgian saison than a hefeweizen.Had I not poured it out of the bottle myself I would never have known/guessed it was a hefeweizen.I’ll certainly get it again! 1331 characters Jeffreysan \n",

      "Carbonation is fairly intense. Taste is strongly wheaty with only a bit of lemon in the background providing any depth in flavor. A mild but still significant bitter aftertaste.IMO this tastes much more like an American Wheat Ale than a Hefeweizen. But regardless of its category I think it lacks flavor and is too bitter on the back end.I remembered liking Widmer Hef in the past but maybe my tastes have changed since then. After this recent experience I'll be avoiding this brew. :( 493 characters mblakesley \n",

      " 3Served from a 12 oz bottle.Pours a semi-opaque coppery orange with a substantial off white head that dissipates fairly quickly leaving about a quarter inch of foam.Aroma is disappointingly faint featuring none of the classic banana bubblegum notes I associate with this style. Basically all that is to be picked up is a muted wheaty malty presence. While it is not unpleasant it is certainly underwhelming.Taste is basically a continuation of this trend which is to say that what is there is pleasing but I wish there were a lot more of it. Wheat and malt notes are in the fore but far too muted to make much of an impact.Mouthfeel is actually above average here. This beer is fairly substantial yet still very smooth and easy drinking. Carbonation is vey pleasant and invigorating.Overall this beer is pleasant and would be appealing on a very hot summer day when you are looking for something to quench your thirst. That said there are several other beers that are far more satisfying and representative of this style. 1039 characters bristol2120 \n",

      " 1.75I really really dislike this beer.The appearance of this beer was the first warning that I was in for big trouble. I tend to like strong bitter ales so imagine how I felt pouring this out into my glass only to see a very bright yellow liquid. I took a deep breath as I continued to pour trying to convince myself that everything would be okay.The smell was very wheaty with vague hints of ripe fruit. It wasn't bad but it wasn't anything special either.The taste was absolutely horrible. The first thing I tasted was something very sweet I took a look at the bottle afterwards to confirm that what I was drinking did indeed have alcohol in it. I took one more sip and focused on the tones. It reminded me of bubblegum and not just a little bit but like I was drinking liquid bubble tape. As the bubblegum faded out the taste that stayed on my back palate was mildly of apricot. It was a total surprise given the smell of the beer.Mouthfeel for me was poor. It felt very weak and while the one positive was that it went down easily I really didn't feel like I was drinking a beer at all. It felt very watered down and left a rather unpleasant aftertaste.Overall I can't see myself ever drinking this beer again. I understand not everyone likes bitter ales and that some people really do love this beer but I can't seem to find much positives with it. 1368 characters StanfordBlack \n",

      " 3.5Cloudy yet substantial in its appearance this Hefe had an almost brown/orange like hue. The head was foamy and tight but ebbed away quickly.Light wheat and bubblegum sweetness on the nose.The flavor is very light and at times undiscernable. More wheat is tasted earthy and starchy with some yeast aspects. Bubblegum-like sweetness and a seltzer water come near the finish.The feel is sprite and prickly but easy to drink. Nothing seems to sit on the stomach so you can tackle a few in a row.Not the most vibrant of Hefe's this does play into some of my preferences. I prefer less clove like flavors and there was none to make this a decent choice. 657 characters KYGunner \n",

      " 5Okay first thing is first a by the book hefeweizen this is not. I really don't know how it is even listed as such more like an American Pale Wheat.The traditional hefeweizen characteristics are not present here. That tidbit aside though and you get the following summation of this delicious brew.This is a very refreshing and delightful brew. Cloudy golden yellow in appearance with a thick fluffy white head that sticks with you to the bottom of the glass.The smell is that of wheat mild hops and a large citrus presence. The taste that followswill put a grin on your face from ear to ear a great tasting citrus & wheat beer flavor.This is what Blue Moon and Shocktop want to be this is what they should have been. The flavor then rounds out with a mild hop bite at the end just enough to let you know it is there and give you that crisp fresh tang at the end.The mouthfeel is mild to moderate. Not so light as to be watery but light enough to be refreshing to the palate. Not sticky or heavy at all and as a smooth character as you take gulp after gulp. Overall this is an awesome brew. I can't think of many better offerings for a warm summer day. This one is awesome in all respects.Would Drink Again: YesWould Purchase Again: Yes 1264 characters JLaw55 \n",

      " 3.25RBTicking this one for an Untappd badge... Surprised I have not reviewed it before... Pours an orange haze with a long lasting white head.Nose is standard \"wheat\" with a little bit of something that I associate with lemon.Flavor is the same... drinkable and light tasting goes down pretty smoothly.Probably the prototype for most American Wheats... but I like mine generally with a lot more hop character.3.5/3.25/3.25/3.5/3.25 438 characters JohnGalt1 \n",

      " 5This American style hefe tastes delicious every time. Not a strong aroma but nothing but good about it. Pours honeycomb yellow. . I am biased because I live in Portland where it is brewed. Widmer is available on tap here almost everywhere and is a fail safe in Oregon. There are always exciting new things to try here but no matter what Widmer is available and never disappointing. Hopefully the bar is smart enough to keep the keg upside down before tapping so that when it is tapped the unfiltered goodness is as mixed as possible.

      " 5Here's the deal.I drink beer when I want it. And that's occasionally not all the time and certainly not for the reason of 'social' though I enjoy being social but I only drink beer when my body truly wants beer. If I'm merely being social I'll have nothing or maybe water.. or maybe beer if my body is really wanting/ready for a beer.Basic description is this is an excellent medium body beer unfiltered which I prefer often times unless it's just blazing hot and I've had some other food in which case I'll just have true light beers.It's not dry it's got a great wet quenchingness about it. Great for warm and hot days depending on you and your circumstances.Mellow mild sweet fruity fragrance some citrusy-ness not particularly acid just a beautiful balance  reminding me of the Munich Germany weiss/weizen beers.Very satisfying beer.I had a Widmer Hefeweizen a few years ago but couldn't stand it very dry in it's character as though it need a some citrus added to it. From my experience yesterday and today with two Hefe six packs from two different stores... they fixed that and now it's SooooPerrrrB.I have no complaints about this beer so why should I give it anything less than 100% = 5/5This beer is so satisfying so beautifully balanced my body loves it!!!!I wouldn't change anything about it it's maximum satisfaction for my body.Beer is great food and great body therapy on occasion variable per person.Know thyself let your body prudently direct.And no I didn't go through both six packs... yet that'll be over the course of a week probably though I have had six in the past 24+ hours. That's very rare for me but I haven't eaten as much taking a little rester and it's been very hot unseasonably hot.Also they've got a new bottle graphic not the one shown in the picture. 1844 characters Bondonnalotus \n",

      " 3.75Hazy golden-orange low foam for just a while which is not traditional for a hefeweizen. Lots of floating bits tho.Smell is citrusy low banana and clove but lots of spicy hops.Really fruity with tropical passion fruit banana red apple lime and grapefruit. Lots of citrus peel and bubblegum. Wheaty malts. Spicy with white pepper clove faint anise and some sweet dark spice like cinnamon or nutmeg. Spicy herbal hops in the finish packing a decent bitterness but not covering up the lingering fruitiness.Not as \"chunky\" as a German weizen but zesty and refreshing.Wouldn't call it a hefeweizen but it's a nice tasty wheat ale. 644 characters dcmchew \n",

Citrus flavor.M: Crisp but much less thick than I'd expect for Hefeweizen.Completely disappointed. Went into this expecting a traditional Hefeweizen but got an \"American Hefeweizen\" instead; definitely not to my taste. I don't often do this but I poured this out after finishing about half of it. The flavor just got worse and worse. If I should happen across another bottle at some point I'll edit this if the future tasting is any better. 626 characters Stranger5582 \n",

      " 4Picked up in the world market 30% off build your own 6 pack.Appearance: orange colored with a mild hazyness. Pours easy which is unusual and makes a decent head. Its head would probably be of a proper size in a Hefe glass (I used my scottish beer glass). I would say that it looks nice. 4Smell: Its smell is a bit weak but present and to style. Some spice smell (nutmeg\\clove) with a banana like ester (think the smell you get from banana laffy taffy). Both are very reserved and a sweet malt grain aroma comes ahead stronger than these traditional flavors. not bad. 3.75Taste: to be honest this beer has a unique flavor profile as noted below. It is defiantly american and wears it like a badge. The flavor of this one comes very strongly for its malt. Its wheat character is very bright and lovely and this beer feels a lot more like a american wheat ale than a hefe but its close enough in my opinion. Not as much hops as you might think but its a bit present (but hard to taste through the carbonation). A good experience. 4Mouthfeel: This beer has a carbonation to it but it oddly enough does not bit your tongue very hard. It also feels like it has a heavy mouthfeel from the wheat and yeast. Id say to style of American hefe. 3.75Overall: Now this brew is one that I thought was very nice. One word review: approachable. This is a great starter hefe and something that your friends will enjoy as much as you will. Id say that its good with every meal after brunch (within reason) and is a good go-to beer that has is own style and flavors separate from other traditional hefe beers and is worth trying at full price (bar or retail 6 packs). 4Would have again.Odd tasting notes: Id say that this beer had a taste I I would say is almost wine like....particularly the low ABV wine my dad used to pick up for passover (joyven red). A fruity sherbet like flavor. I like it It takes me back to good times ^^ 1936 characters jucifer1818 \n",

      " 4.5I am wheat beer guy so I figured I would give this a chance since I heard good things about it. Even though its not a German Hefeweizen I found it very good. This was my first beer from Widmer so I was skeptical at first. Definitely recommend it to any wheat beer fans out there. 279 characters CGiusti23 \n",

      " 3.5I understand this was the beer that created the US style Hefeweizen around three decades ago.Hazy golden color with a thin head with short retention.Aroma of fresh oranges some banana and floral and herbal hops.Refreshing flavor of pale and wheat malt oranges bread and pineapple after warming up. Dry and bitter aftertaste.Light body with good carbonation and a light tartness.Interesting Hefeweizen wheat and yeast is not really predominant here and it is packed with twice as much of IBUs in comparison to the standard style (30 from US hops varieties). Making it closer to a smooth Pale Ale and being less cloying. 628 characters FLima \n",

      " 3.5Poured a cloudy golden pale color with a thin off-white head. Some floating particles were visible in the beer. Smelled of orange banana lemon. However the aroma was not overly strong and it was difficult to really decipher the flavors. Taste not much flavor but could pick up on the citrus flavors. Light body some carbonation. again nothing that really stood out. Decent brew but nothing earth-shattering here. 420 characters ChrisL24481 \n",

      " 3.25Sampled on 11/26/13. Bottled chilled down to 36 degrees F in my beer cooler and poured in to a pilsner glass.Pours a hazy golden yellow/orange in color with a small white fizzy head. Some spotty lacing was seen but not a lot. The aroma is of wheat grassy grain and citrus. The taste was similar with a light hint of spice as well. A slight hoppy aftertaste was noted but not too strong. Slightly drier finish as well as some other Hefe's. Above average carbonation. First brew I have had from this company but seen a few others types they make around. 554 characters BeerWithMike \n",

      " 3.75The key to rating this beer is on the label. It says American Hefeweizen. This is not a german hefe and should not be treated like one. It will be lighter in texture and drier. There may even be a hint of bitterness to it. These are all there. Having said that it could still be more. The aroma is more like a wheat ale. It is a bit muted with a floral touch. The body is light and the mouthfeel is lively. The finish again is dry with a touch of hop bitterness. A good example of an Americanized hefeweizen. Refreshing. 521 characters chickenflea \n",

      " 3.5Pour is average with the typical hefeweizen cloudy color and an unimpressive head. Smell leads with the spice but there are the usual banana and clove notes in there too. The smell is misleading as the taste may not have enough spice and is largely about the wheat with subtle banana clove and lemon. It's equally sweet and tart. Mouthfeel is medium-thick (for a hefeweizen) with a touch of crispness but could maybe use a touch more. I didn't like this beer at all during my first sips but it got better and that's likely due to it warming up a bit and me noticing some of the more subtle flavors there. I usually prefer a more straightforward hefeweizen but for more advanced palates (and for those who are not opposed to drinking this at temperatures above 40 degrees) this is likely to be enjoyed for what it is (assuming you like wheat that doesn't attach too tightly to yeast flavors as the yeast here is concealed). 929 characters DeFaz \n",

What's going on here?Taste confirms it: Hefeweizen in name only. Hop bitterness and flavor predominate and are more in line with a standard bitters. Wheat and malt both very subduedMouthfeel is smooth enough; I guess there is some wheat in here after all.Generally a disappointment; neither as interesting nor as refreshing as a hefeweizen and the amount of hops doesn't go well with the wheat character. 598 characters blacktieman \n",

I hate to use the phrase twice but it has a pineapple aroma too. Really digging the smell. It's soothing.T- Initial reaction to this was \"Mmmmm\". All the tropical aromas come out on the second sip. Makes it almost too easy to drink.M- Actually feels a bit full on the palate. Light carbonation makes it very smooth. Has the same citrus bite of fresh squeezed OJ.O- I really enjoyed this one.

      " 3.5A: Cloudy yellowish orange with very low head. Tiny light yellow foam ring. Mild carbonation.S: Wheat mild sweetness. Lemon and light orange peel with coriander. Mild yeastiness.T: Clean crisp and tangy up front. Sweet lemon (sour lemonade?) rushes in. Finishes tangy again from the carbonation.M: Finishes clean from the tanginess. I like how the unfiltered fullness balances nicely with the tang.O: Refreshing. It paired well with sharp food; I had a blue cheese salad with this and this lighter beer really played well with the stinky cheese. Not a big beer by any means but can really hit the spot on a hot day. And it doesn't need the lemon it came with in my honest opinion. 690 characters constantine_272 \n",

      " 3.75Poured a cloudy yellow with a finger and a half fluffy white head. Quite attractive and probably the best part of the beer. Scents of wheat malt slight citrus and a faint hint of floral notes. The scents of an American Pale Wheat ale. The flavor followed the nose wheat malt some citrus mild floral hops and hop bitterness with bready yeast and some sour notes on the finish. The flavors of an American Pale Wheat ale. The mouthfeel was light bodied with high carbonation. The texture and mouthfeel of an American Pale Wheat ale. This was an American Pale Wheat ale a good one but nothing special. Just one of very many in a very crowded field. While it was one of the first major examples of the style it simply does not hold up to the best of the field. But on a summer day with nothing else but PBR it is quite nice. 829 characters Auraan \n",

      " 4A surprise find on Disney property - certainly better than some of the other big name brands they had available.The brew pours out an appealing orangish-yellow that although opaque was nice on the eyes little to no head or lacing though. It had a citrusy smell with strong malty scents and some other spices I couldn't tell. I really like it when I can taste what I smell and this beer delivered on that. Definite taste of orange mixed with lime and some spices (that again I couldn't tell what they were.) It had a strong pale ale aftertaste that offset the light carbonation that I like so much. Overall it was a good beer. I had two of them and won't hesitate to try another one again. 694 characters jjamadorphd \n",

      " 2I don't normally write reviews other than an overall number but I was so wildly disappointed in this beer that I felt it necessary. I bought a selection of Hefeweizen's from Trader Joe's that I had never had before as the weather has been quite nice and obviously they are usually a nice pair.I don't know how Widmer Brothers can call this a hefeweizen. I can't call myself an expert but I am fairly familiar with hefeweizens and this is nothing like any I have ever had in a bad way. The only obvious flavors are wheat and yeast and the yeastiness is incredibly dilute much akin to Bud Light or something similarly shitty. I can't qualify the wheat flavor because it is too weak which is odd considering the importance of wheat in a hefeweizen. MAYBE I can taste a tiny bit of apple but it is very much an afterthought only notable after burping. I can maybe notice a slight spiciness if I sit here and focus completely on every sip. But the various citrus/fruit flavor spiciness and wheat prominence one would expect is severely lacking. There is zero body to this beer.I will finish it only because I paid for it. I would definitely hesitate to call it undrinkable as there isn't anything particularly offputting (just lacking in the first place) but it is DEFINITELY NOT WORTH DRINKING again or for the first time. I have been drinking exclusively craft beer for about a year now (by that I really only mean I do not drink Bud-anything Miller PBR etc. I certainly will drink from larger breweries like New Belgium or Sierra Nevada) and this is definitely the most disappointing beer I have had during that time. I have had a few DIPA's that I could not finish because of the bitterness but at least they had other redeeming qualities. There are hundreds of other hefeweizens out there that are a thousand times better. 1839 characters saiconotto \n",

Smell is sweet wheat yeast citrus pretty much about it. The taste is about the same with a kinda thin mouthfeel almost watery touch to it.

      " 4.25Widmer Hefeweizen is one of my favorite american beers. It has a wonderful smell and nice creamy rich color. It is very drinbkable and is not overhopped like most smaller brewing company's are. I thought that this beer had a wonderful head that can only be appreciated if you pour it into a glass first. I think that most beers are improved by releasing them from the bottle before drinking. 391 characters jesseejames \n",

      " 3.75Overall this is a fairly good Hefeweizen. Like some beers from Widmer Brothers there seems to be a little something missing which could turn a good beer into a great beer. This one falls into that category. Appearance and smell are good. Taste is very pleasing and there are no offensive flavors. Mouthfeel is fantastic! This is an incredibly smooth drinking beer that doesn't weigh you down. I would definitely recommend this beer for any sort of summertime cookout. I will definitely buy another case in the future. However I'll also be buying some oranges to accompany said case. ;) 586 characters floodgates289 \n",

      " 2.75I had this on draft at some bar in Charleston I can't remember the name of it for the life of me. The flavor and smell were a bit dull maybe it's just a bit more malty than I'm used to for a wheat beer like this. The mouthfeel and head were a little weak as well in my opinion usually you want that grainly bready feeling in your mouth that just...wasn't there for me. Typically like a bit more citrus flavor here as well. 425 characters MarkQ617 \n",

      " 4(on tap at the Widmer Gasthaus April 2013)A: bright yellow-gold fairly cloudy.... beautiful head retention minimum lacingS: mellow dinner-roll/doughy maltiness some faint banana esters hops about nilT: lightly doughy white-bready.... nice balance of citrusy esters.... \"American\" flavors (hop?) and bitterness level....nice long malty aftertaste - this actually tastes more like a hefeweizen than a simple wheat pale aleM: medium-bodied... the carbonation opens up the body a little more than what I prefer (which is a smoother denser malt foundation with the bubbles only hitting up front and maybe in the end)... does feel like it has a touch of weight in the finish but it soon washes away clean and light yet feels satisfyingly fillingO: actually good! - so much better and more to it than the crap that we get in bottles out east... likely doesn't hold up well in storage and Widmer just doesn't have the name recognition out here to move it 964 characters Bouleboubier \n",

      " 4Poured into a fluted pilsner glass.Look: An unfiltered golden color with a soapy white head that calms to a film. Very light lacing stays on the glass.Aroma: Grassy malty sweet with banana notes.Taste: Starts with a nice mellow malt sweetness. Transitions into more floral and banana notes with a hint of citrus in the finish.Mouthfeel: Bright and carbonated.Overall: A nice brew to session outdoors in nice weather. I like the overall flavor profile here. 469 characters JuicesFlowing \n",

      " 3.25Pours a hazy translucent golden hefeweizen color with a thick foamy head that leaves ample lacing. Adjuncty corn scent comes through the sudsy cap along with a bit of ethanol. Smells a bit lemony but the overall aroma is typical of wheat beer. The mouthfeel is fuller than average for the style and carbonation is medium. Grassy and orange hops lend flavor to munich and pale malts. The smell becomes sweeter and betrays a doughy note as the beer warms; I'll give it a higher score than the 2.75 I originally assigned. This beer has some lemony sweet-tartness. It is almost a true-to-style hefeweizen but pale wheat ale is probably more accurate. It's better than Pyramid's \"hefeweizen\" if we are to compare similar offerings from Northwest mega-craft breweries. 767 characters sam_bliss \n",

      " 3.5Poured from the bottle into a wheat ale style glass.Barely a finger of head is made off the pour with a very soapy and hardly any retention. Dissolves very quickly with a thin soapy collar. Body is opaque with a very orange appearance and classic lemon hues on the bottom. Cola like bubbles and fast rising carbonation.Candy like orange nose with a sweet powdery sense. Dry penny candy. Chalky. A weak grainy character hides behind this. No sense of esters.Taste wise improves a bite. Small chewy wheat grain body with a nice sweetness. Orange flavors and light tang like juice seem to come over the palate. Kind of a nice bitter hop angle which mixes with the citrus orange character nicely. Candy like palate but not overboard on the sweetness but quite wet though to go along with it. A quick sharp carbonation feel also like Perrier but flattens very quickly.Overall nothing spectacular but not a bad beer I could easily drink plenty of these it's very easy drinking. 986 characters Smakawhat \n",

      " 3.75Sunshine yellow with slight haze steady stream of bubbles and lumpy off white head that fades to film.Big lemon cookie and banana nose - no clove.Breadstick malts with slight toast then banana and melon following by slight grassy hop finish. Sweetens as it warms.Starfruit finish and clean slightly clovey linger.Light creamy clingy but dry.As one of America's Ur beers totally stands up. Favors the fruit but never cloying though I can't say I get any Cascade. What it lacks in depth it makes up for in balance and could be an all-day summer beer.Unfortunately a few other reviews rightly point out that this is far more an American Wheat than a classic hefe especially for the total lack of clove so I have to knock a few points off to rate to styleStill a perennial favorite. 799 characters StJamesGate \n",

      " 4Some craft beers taste like charade clues they're so desperate to hit all the style points but this beer just seems like it wants to be a nice drink. In my view it can sleep well tonight. It's doesn't try to hit the drinker over the head with bold fruitiness or potpourri level spicing. It's cloudy but not like pond scum. In other words it's as if its creators said \"hey let's make a nice hefe\" rather than \"let's shock the world.\" (Kind of reminds me of a creamsicle.) 478 characters seymourcox \n",

      " 4Bottled 15JAN13Turbid apricot with some a sheet of light cream atop. Smells of grain lemon corander some bits of sweet bread. Flavor is grain light malts some sweet wheat very simple flavor; nothing like a hefeweizen - good for an APWA. Medium on full bodied with lighter carb and dry finish. Overall a really drinkable beer and honestly can't hate on it much isn't exceptional in any way except the sessionability. 425 characters harrymel \n",

      " 3.5Widmer’s Hefeweizen opens to a crisp aroma full of fresh grains and sugars. Though light the nose still carries nice touches of apple orange berry and apricot fruit esters as well as a shade of brown sugar and earthy hay toast and biscuit notes with a slight grapefruit counter from the hops. The aromas are light enough as to fade to near-imperceptibility within a few seconds the beer needing a swirl to generate a fresh waft. Doing so brings about a larger sugary presence with berries especially emphasized as well as wildflower honey. As a whole the aromas are very nice having good balance and are marred mainly by being extremely light.On the tongue the beer is simultaneously grainy and sugary the former notes including fresh wet wheat toast crust biscuit and Grape Nuts cereal and the latter bringing apple berry apricot and orange fruit esters as well as wildflower honey. There’s also an almost Belgian-like tinge of banana and clove which adds a nice bit of nuance but dies off within a few seconds. Hops add a touch of pine and grapefruit. As the beer is held on the tongue and the sugars die off the grains become stronger being reminiscent of honey wheat bread. The aftertaste features a return of the berry and honey sugars with honey wheat bread and fresh wet wheat also present as well as a light grapefruit rind and pine note from the hops and lingers for a decent while. Mouthfeel is medium-light and carbonation is medium.As a whole the flavors in this beer are very nice and delicately balanced between grains and sugars both ends of that spectrum featuring a good variety of flavors. The beer’s main weakness is simply its strength: at 4.9% ABV there’s just not enough malt in here to go around and the result comes across as weak and watery. Were this boosted up to 6.5-7% the result would likely be amazing. 1884 characters jondeelee \n",

      " 4A – A deep wheat colored body with a very slight off-white head that is fleeting even as I key this note. It is certainly somewhat lacking though there is a healthy amount of carbonation flowing up the glass.S – The smell is almost not even worth noting. It is bereft of almost any sort of character I literally cannot pinpoint a smell. It is just somewhat bland with a slight wheat/barley element in it and a vague tartness.T – Thankfully the beer is better than the nose. But honestly water would be an improvement upon this aroma. It is very mild and I could literally drink ten of these it is so calm tempered yet it is really not bad; there is certainly something to be said for drinkability—basically meaning that it’s not flat out bad. It is entirely ok. The beer lover in me rejoices even at sipping this because it is somewhat well made and tastes mild but slightly enticing but my reason compels me to say that this beer when it comes to flavor is incredibly mediocre. Wheat perhaps a nice yeastiness sure but where are the defining characteristics? Where is the banana the clove the spice? Still there is something to be said for drinkability and this is compulsively sippable (just found out this is not a word but it’s stupid that it’s not sippable should absolutely be a word).M – I mean the mouthfeel is nice enough but it isn’t great either and offers little redemption. It is light to medium bodied good carbonation sticks on the palate for a moment and has a relative smoothness; but not much else to say.O – Eh…In fact that should be the name of this beer. “‘Eh’ the mildest most flavorless beer this side of the Mississippi—and we don’t care what side you’re on!’ Not highly recommended. It is not bad at all don’t get me wrong but it is a far cry from great...PS this beer deserves better than the score it has received from me. I gave it a 4 overall and it hovers around that even though each of it's parts falls short of that. 2018 characters KKB \n",

      " 412oz bottle labeled july 2012couldy pale gold/pumpkin color with a small film that barely passes as a head. smell is wheat yeast some spice hint of banana. taste follows very light and bready but with a terrific finish of orange marmalade and spice. Feel is too crisp and frothy it detracts from the taste.This was a filling hefe maybe the ageing put some meat on it's bones. Good take by widmer. 408 characters jimmah120 \n",

      " 3Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Paulaner weizen glass. Taken from a Widmer Brothers variety pack.Appearance: Pours a hazy straw color. Has a smallish fizzy head that dissipates quickly and leaves little lacing.Smell: Has a wheaty citrusy aroma like most hefeweizens.Taste: Mildly bitter. Has a fruity citrusy flavor backed by a spicy wheatiness and a bit of yeast.Mouthfeel: Light-bodied and well-carbonated.Overall: A pretty run-of-the-mill wheat beer. Nothing offensive but there a definitely better examples of the style out there. 553 characters mckenziac \n",

      " 5A great American wheat. It's smooth and refreshing. It's not as spicy as a traditional hefe but it's a smooth tasty wheat. It's so smooth it can be dangerous because it goes down so easy...so beware...you could over-indulge. this is my favorite everyday hefe. A very nice brewery...Their Drop Top Amber is very smooth too. If you want a smooth balanced wheat this is a perfect beer.... Not as spicy as a traditional Bavarian style hefe though. 446 characters Johnlikeshefe \n",

      " 3Poured from bottle into pint glassAppearance – Pours a hazy golden orange color with almost no head. With almost no head upon pouring there was almost no lacing.Smell – The aroma is heaviest of wheat with some lighter notes of orange and yeast. Mixed with these is a slightly bready smell. Overall the aroma is rather light.Taste – The taste starts out with some malt yeast and a wheat flavor. These flavors create a base for eh beer and remain relatively consistent throughout the taste. While initially not present some citrus of orange and lemon come to the tongue in the middle of the taste. In the end a lighter orange taste comes to the tongue and sweetens it a bit. With this orange flavor a yeasty wheat orange flavor are left on the tongue.Mouthfeel – The body for the beer is on the average side in terms of creaminess and it has a carbonation level that is just slightly above normal. Good for the flavors and style but nothing all that exceptional.Overall – It was an alright hefeweizen but really noting to go out of your way for. Just OK. 1077 characters Darkmagus82 \n",

I bought it on a whim and I'll probably buy it again. A: Hazy apricot to gold lacing disipating instantly thin barely-there head. S: Bready and yeasty like a bakery that made a lemon pound cake yesterday the faint lemon notes add to the aroma. T: Drinkable for mostly anyone. A good on hand beer from company. A perfect Tuesday or Thursday night brew. Sweet enough to make it easy to pass up the diet coke. M: Smooth and Light. 650 characters kristenrae8 \n",

The head dissipates and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The smell is nothing to write home about. The taste is slightly fruity with a flat and dry aftertaste. It is not a true hefeweizen in my book. It is just an average beer not good not bad. 381 characters Jsteez \n",

      " 2.5I’d say this was a disappointing take on a hefewiezen but to be honest I wasn’t expecting much to begin with. Pours hazy light gold with a finger of white head but not much retention or lacing to speak of. The appearance was a bit lacking I’m afraid as the better examples of this style usually have a big fluffy head that hangs around a while. The nose further alerted me to what would be a mediocre overall experience; where was the banana and clove and all the other yeasty esters one expects in this style? Instead I got very grainy malt wheat and a bit of lemony citrus.The taste followed the nose; all of those yeasty flavors were either muted or totally absent; despite the label this beer is classified correctly here; it’s an American Pale Wheat Ale not a Hefe; all I get is grainy malt and wheat; a bit of mild citrus hopping. Sweetness is fortunately low and the finish is pretty dry. Still the body was medium and the carbonation was pretty moderate screwing up the mouthfeel so that it lacked crispness and the clean drinking refreshment of the better beers of either style. This one just didn’t do it for me at all and I wouldn’t have this again. Sorry Widmer this ain’t cutting it. 1221 characters tobelerone \n",

      " 3.5Poured in pilsner glass bottle. When you pour it it pours a deep orange color. Adding the yeast gives it a wonderful hazy golden color; exactly what I expect for the style. There is honey and apricot on the nose but it is very subtle and opens up more over several minutes. Apricot again on the taste and a little banana. Flowery hops that take a big center stage more than I would expect. Thin mouthfeel with a crisp finish that disappears suddenly. Overall a good beer just different than other hefeweizens I have had. 525 characters estlinska \n",

      " 3Widmer Hefewiesen: Had a chance to try this beer at the in-laws. Hard to review beers well amist conversation of a social gathering but here goes. Proper hefe color and head. The aroma has the expected citrus prominence. Decent flavor overall the citrus comes through the wheat is there the light malt sweetness is well balanced. A good effort. Not on par with the German imports of this style but on target. If in need of a hefe the Widmer will do! 455 characters iSip \n",

Hops are wrong as is the carbonation. This beer is a charlatan. The hoppy bitterness is unlike any Heffe I've ever tasted and Widmer is a total misrepresentation of the style. Not a bad beer but it takes more than a bit of wheat in the wert to be a Heffe and being a lover of this style as well as the Belgian wittes I wouldn't purchase this stuff again. 600 characters theBubba \n",

Dissipates to light lacing around the edges with patches of lace all around.S: Wheats and grain on the nose with a bit of citrus. Catching some bready yeast scents as well towards the end but they are very faint.T: Nice wheat and corn flavoring. Can taste the maltyness and grain as you could catch with the nose earlier. Citrus flavors are def. noticeable but the usual spice notes are very very faint towards the end. M: Light carbonation works well with the flavors. Smooth and creamy feeling left on the palette on the aftertaste.O: Not bad a bad Hefe but i'm used to more fruit flavors and spice.

      " 3Poured this American Pale Wheat Ale from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a pale amber color produced a nice white head average retention and lacing. The aroma of this ale consists of bread fruity yeast. Light in body this wheat beer has a foundation of grain and bread. There is some hop bittering and it finishes dry. Overall I was only mildly impressed with this beer- It gets a lot of buzz about being one of the founding craft beers- I was expecting a lot more. BTW...This is not a Hefeweizen..Geez. Prost! 524 characters GossageBrewery \n",

      " 5In my opinion this is the best Hefeweizen in the country. I will admit I am a little biased being that I am from the west coast and am a big fan of west coast brewers. This is great with a little orange peel or even just by itself. It is a great summer beer and can be enjoyed just sitting out grilling.It provides a nice smooth flavor with a slightly cloudy look. Though the Wilamette hops are some of the best in the world and just enhance the flavor of the beer. 467 characters pwf316 \n",

      " 3.512 oz bottle dated 23 Aug. 2011 poured into a snifter. A: Initial pour was clear but some cloudy liquid towards the bottom of the bottle was added as well. Golden apricot color with almost no head and little lacing.S: Yeasty and quite fruity with a touch of light malt. No clove and only a vague hint of banana or here and very little in the taste. T: Slightly malty with a light hop presence a bit of citrus lightly nutty and little of the yeastiness expected in a hefeweizen; but then I see BA has classified this as an American Pale Wheat Ale which seems more fitting. Light sweetness up front turns mildly bitter by the finish. M: near medium body; very good carbonation level; light dryness in the finish.O: A good easy-to-drink unfiltered wheat beer lacking the pronounced banana/clove yeastiness I'm not very fond of anyway. Excellent with Chinese food. (revisited with slightly more favorable impression in July 2013). 946 characters chinchill \n",

      " 3Appearance - Pours a hazy golden yellow with a white finger width head. Sparse semi-sticky lacing.Smell - Primarily wheat with very faint banana sitting behind this. Taste - A strong lemon zest and wheat flavor dominates. Bitter lemon rind in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel - Light watery. Carbonation is moderate. Decent bite.Overall - As a beer it passes as average as a hefeweizen it's a joke. Any banana detected on the nose does not translate to tongue. Lots of lemon citrus and wheat. 500 characters TheSixthRing \n",

      " 3.5Reviewed from notes. Had on-tap at Talking Pint in Riverview FL. Served in a pint glass.A: Pours a hazy gold - so hazy that it nears opacity. One finger's worth of white head and a modest amount of visible carbonation.S: Grainy wheat lemon and coriander with a bit of spicy and grassy hops.T: Follows the nose. Wheat grains citrus (orange flavors predominate) and the citrus & grassy hops. Some pilsner malt character as well. Dry and grainy at the finish.M: Medium body for style low carbonation sensation and alcohol presence is minimal.O: Nothing objectionable here but it doesn't stand out. A reasonable summer brew. 639 characters macrosmatic \n",

      " 3Virtually no head but plenty of carbonation present on sight. No real lacing to speak of. A pale and hazy straw color that looks weak and watery. A weak banana and spicy clove aroma in addition to pretty strong grain and wheat smells. Nothing overpowering in terms of aroma. The flavors begin with a bit of lemon that quickly gives way to a mild banana. That quickly gives way to a sharp clove spiciness. The strength of the clove surprised me compared to the ale's other watered down components. There's also a lot of wheat flavors some of which aren't too flattering. The right flavor aspects are present just out of balance. Grainy mouthfeel but still light on the palate with just the right amount of carbonation. It's a light and refreshing beer for the summer but I couldn't see myself having more than one of these a sitting nor would I really go back to it in the future. This is not a beer to seek out in terms of representing the style. 960 characters ExtraStout \n",

      " 3bottle into chilled weizen glass. Served cold. From notes taken 4/5/12A: Cloudy gold color with almost no head and a little bit of lacing from the bubble ring.S: Yeasty with a touch of light malt hardly any hops on the nose just enough to keep it from smelling sweet.T: Slightly malty with an ever so light hop presence not noticeably bitter at all. Not as much yeast at first as on the nose but leaves a yeasty aftertaste that rivals the nose. Not really that complex.M: Sort of thin but has that unique sludgy feel like yeast proofing in water for baking that comes from the being full of suspended yeast.O: A decent unfiltered wheat beer. No wonder it is so popular it is easy to drink. Went surprisingly well with the ribs I was eating. 754 characters N3rdM3t4l \n",

There is an above average amount of carbonation and there is some faint lacing. The head lasted for only a few minutes before it was gone.Smell - Lemon grains yeast coriander/clovesTaste & Mouth - There is an average amount of carbonation and I can taste lemons corn and grains/bread. There is also some very light yeast/spice. It ends with a corn lightly spicy/tart aftertaste.Overall - A decent appearance and a nice scent but the taste falls flat.

A bit bready...Taste citrusy. Some Orange peel is in there somewhere... Surprisingly has a soft bit to it which is I find interesting.Has really comfortable mild carbonation and leave a clean refreshing mouthfeel. I will quite possibly be having more of these.

      " 3.5Pours cloudy light yellow orange with a white 1 finger creamy head that fades slowly leaving good foamy lacing and rings as it goes down. Smells of lemon orange peel wheat grains and yeast; whiffs of coriander clove and a little caramel sweetness come through but this is overall earthy smelling. Tastes of wheat yeast lemon orange peel coriander grains clove light floral hops grass light caramel light banana mild spices earthy notes like peat moss and some sweet malt. Pretty much what you’d expect from a classic Hefeweizen right down to the zesty citrus finish that tart and trails off a little grainy.Crisp zesty mouthfeel this is a very light and refreshing with high fizzy carbonation and an easy flow to it. A session beer that was enjoyable but a little lacking on the flavor overall – could use some stronger coriander and banana flavor to push this up a notch but still a good beer. 930 characters CHickman \n",

      " 3.5Off tap at a beer tasting this beer was a cloudy golden color with one finger of white head. The retention was good and it left spots of lacing as I made my way through it. The aroma was of wheat sweet malt fruity esters and some citrus. The flavors were fine but like many flagship beers I found it very middle-of-the-road. I tasted the wheat malt first followed by notes of banana and lemon and then some coriander before the slightly metallic dry finish. The mouthfeel was good the body medium and the carbonation medium. It would be a good session beer but it’s nothing I would go out of my way to seek. 614 characters thekevlarkid \n",

The taste is wheaty and straw-like up front followed by a lemon zestyness and finishes with a forward yeastiness. The mouthfeel is light well carbonated a little crisp and smooth.This would be a nice light beer for the summer but overall it's rather mediocre and average.

A light bready almost pilsner aroma with faint wheat and citrus. Flavor is light but pleasant wheat and lemon with a decent sweet malt backbone. Light wheat and light hop finish. Surprisingly medium bodied. Pleasant and refreshing. As others note this is not really a hefeweizen but it is a quite pleasant wheat ale. Looks and tastes fine.

None of the spicy banana or clove one expects from a wheat. T: Mild hefe presence in the beginning followed by a touch of spice and some soapiness in the finish. Again everything seems very mass produced and muted. M: Good clean and refreshing. Nice body to this beer unfortunately there isn't much flavor to carry. O: Not overly impressed.

      " 3Picked up a 12-pack while on vacation in San Diego as I figured it was a style the whole family would enjoy. The beer pours a golden hazy color with a 1/4 finger white head with minimal retention and lacing. The nose was unimpressive and didn't present the hefeweizen yeast character expected. A lot of lemony fruity flavors. You can almost taste the sweetness on the nose. The taste follows suit: sweet lemons with minimal malt background. Mild bitterness. Some wheat flavor as well. Lighter end of medium bodied. Adequate carbonation. Overall this really wasn't what I was expecting. Far too sweet and I found the name misleading as it didn't seem like a hefeweizen. That said the non-beer drinkers in the family really enjoyed how easy drinking they found it and enjoyed the sweetness and lemons so to each their own. Not for me. 837 characters hopfacebrew \n",

      " 3.5theyre famous for this one. pours thick and cloudy as can be. minimal head and just a really dense looking brew. literally looks like a hangover. smells very wheat prominent with yeast and orange peel as well slightly acidic in that regard. flavor is quite good not so much heffe as it is just a wheat beer for me but i do not dislike this. more malty and less yeasty than it looks bready a bit in the finish citrus too. mouthfeel is more heavy than most of these which i appreciate. not a session beer in the form i had it today but distinct and fairly solid. worked with some spicy mexican food 604 characters StonedTrippin \n",

      " 3.5Ordered from local Buffalo Wild Wings as I was looking for something sessionable to go with my food and had not tried one of these before. The pour was a little disappointing with little head and spotty lacing. Zero retention. Minimal aroma with some wheat grass lemon and cloves. Taste was actually pretty good. Medium body with a crisp wheat and hop balance. Middle of the road for the style. Well rounded and easy to hit pretty heavy. Feel was what you would expect from a wheat. Medium carbonation but not too watery. A little zest to it on the tongue. Overall- Not a bad wheat and easy to drink several. Not complex but not over the top. A good simple wheat that went great with some wings. Wouldn't turn one down. Refreshing- 736 characters TheDinger \n",

      " 3.5Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.I ordered this beer at a Buffalo Wild Wings for two reasons. They didn't have very many craft beers available and I had never had it before.A-Nice golden look with a good head. I was pleasantly surprised at its appearance.S-It had a good aroma better than I had expected. Wheat and hints of caramel maybe?T-It had a decent taste to it. I have had better wheat beers but this wasn't bad. Very wheaty and other grains present.M-Good carbonation and went down smooth. It is light bodied but what wheat beer isn't. O-Overall this is a decent wheat beer. I have had a few wheat beers and this is somewhere in the middle. I would probably drink this again especially compared to the other selections I was presented with. 768 characters Jra1985 \n",

      " 3.5Poured into a snifter this hefe pours hazy golden with a nice head that quickly diminished to barely a skim. The aroma is sweet and wheaty with low fruity spicy esters. The flavor is crisp grainy wheat that finishes dry and fairly clean--just a bit of lingering malt and esters. The carbonation is medium-high with medium-light body. Overall an average beer nothing to get excited about yet still well crafted. 414 characters uwmgdman \n",

      " 412oz bottle into pint sized Hefeweizen glass. Freshness date reads 10/Aug/11. Does that mean it is expired ?A: Lacing is great head quite ample and stays around for about 3 minutes. Color is a hazy gold.S: German smelling hops here smells a bit like a German pils but with some wheat mellowness. Very inviting smell.T: Certainly no Hefeweizen here there's no clove and no banana very clean fermentation profile. Pretty dry but not overly so. Hops dominate sailing on wheaty maltiness.M: The carbonation is strong with this one but in line with the viscosity coming from this unfiltered brew.Overall this is an incredibly fresh tasting balanced and pleasant brew. Just don't get confused by the Hefeweizen label it is nothing of the sort. 754 characters atlason \n",

Now seeing that this beer is labeled as a American Pale Wheat Ale I understand the nose more.T-Clearly an APWA. Much more assertive and hoppy than A Hefeweizen. That being said there is some nice bright citrus hops. Grains and wheat too. Lemony citrus accompanies the wheat on the back end. Lightly bitter but still decently sweet as well.M-Crisp but more sturdy in the body. A bit dry. Good carbonation. Medium bodied. Refreshing.O/D-Does not taste like a Hefeweizen. Definitely more like an APWA. Either way I actually did enjoy this one. I liked their IPA on tap better but this was not bad either. Not expecting what I got but I liked it. 831 characters VelvetExtract \n",

      " 3.5Pours a cloudy tawny yellow in the glass with one finger of head. Some lacing on the glass as you sip. I get coriander lemon pale pilsner malt really no hops to speak of in the nose. A bit of funk as well. Pale malt citurs and a bit nutty flavor. Very light mouthfeel watery well carbonated. This is a solid hef. I'm not a fan of the wheat ale category but this is a good stand by. The nuttiness really stands out to me and separates it from the other hefs on the market. The other major factor that separates it is the fact that it isn't all lemon or too funky. Can we get the hefeweizens a little more balanced people? Would be very good on a hot day or with a mild fish. Good to have to mix things up. 717 characters Philousa \n",

There is a one finger head that quickly dissipates into almost nothing. Minimal lacing left on the glass.Smell: Smells of hops and pine resins a bit of fruitiness.Taste: It's pretty ok. There is a taste of wheat and hops in the forefront with a following of citrus/fruitiness. Not bad.Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied with almost no carbonation.Overall: A beer that I would try again for sure.

Lots of white head and tons of lacing.S: Light hints of banana some vegetal comes through over time. Very light on the nose.T: Once again alight body for flavour. Hints of banana some spiciness in there perhaps from the hops. Enjoyable enough though one dimensional and nothing to write home about.M: Fairly viscous light sweetness.O: I love a good Hefeweizen and this is certainly no hefe... I can see why they describe it otherwise here... Good enough for what it is but more banana more clove! 684 characters kjyost \n",

The smell has some minor wheat and slight melons and lemons but nothing special. The taste has some light fruit and a lemon kick on the swallow. More wheat in the mix too but not really digging the combo. Bitter aftertaste. Overall I have had this a few times and each time I have not been impressed. Probably just not my style. Better Hefe's out there as well as wheat brews. But of course...no lemon allowed. 588 characters kaseydad \n",

And it DEFINITELY tastes like one. You got bright bitter hops up front ontop the citrus with the wheat finishing up after. A light hint of clove and banana are there but its difficult to pick them out when the hops are kinda throwing the balance off.Mouthfeel: Lingers after waking up your tongue. A bit thick but doesn't last too long.Overall: Well if you like wheats and you like pale ales this pretty much accomplishes both...but it leans more in favor of the pale ale. Its smoother than pale ales I've tried before too. Its worth a try I suppose but I don't particularly like the two styles mixed here... 893 characters DM1293 \n",

      " 3The pour is a beautiful burst of cloudy yellow sunshine...Light lemony scents and some mild wheat predominantly make up the nose which is very weak for some reason. Wheat water is the flavor of the day! Some sweet lemon grass and mild orange juice also. Good medio-light body and sudsy carbonation make a worthwhile texture on the tongue and cheeks. Widmer seems to be a good starting place for those heading into craft beer. A nice mild wheat ale that many pop a lemon slice into. Enjoy! 490 characters JoeAmerican77 \n",

Not a strong nose but a nicely balanced citrus taste and well-rounded mouthfeel. Overall a beer that deserves a higher rating and has earned its spot as Widmer's flagship brew. 310 characters Jkess89 \n",

The smell of the beer has the soft aromas of banana and clove that most Hefeweizens traditionally have. The mouthfeel of the beer is smooth a little watered down but could be much worse.

      " 2.5Hefeweizen usually brings to mind a sweet flavorful beer. Poured to a bottle this had a golden color. Yet it had almost no aroma. This was a bad sign. The initial taste was a watered down banana flavor that seemed to just fade to nothingness. No interesting aftertaste. The mouthfeel was typical for a hefe which is to say it there was not much to it after the light carbonation. Generally this is typical of the style. A watered-down sweet flavor is not typical of the style. 480 characters JohnnyHopps \n",

      " 3.5Enjoyed on-tap @ the 3 Kings Public House in The Loop (St. Louis) MO for $4. Tapped from the Wooden handle w/ a \"W\" on the top & Hefeweizen labeled down the side into a 16oz Ranger IPA Pint Glass. Aroma- Has a slight hint of lemon citrus hop in the smell. Very wheat malts and a low amount of grain is noticeable but everything stands back. Appearance- Received with a .5 finger head that dies quickly. Has a very cloudy dark orange color body that looks like there is a ton of mass involved. Leaves almost no lacing behind. Flavor- Has a strong grainy and lemon taste all the way through the drink. It is definitely sweet and has a sharp bite on the finish. Very nice!Mouthfeel- Light-Medium Bodied Medium-High Carbonation and tastes as if a lemon was squeezed into the glass. This citrus flavor was very favorable. Overall Impression- While a lemon was served on the side of the glass there was no need for it! Very strong lemon taste all the way through and great for a Hefe! The season is almost over for enjoying this brew (for me at least) so this may be my last one I enjoyed on-tap. Also for my first brew from Widmer I'm excited to try more from them! Seems like they know what they're doing. 1219 characters DCon \n",

The taste was a bit malty and you can pick up the wheat a little; strong citrus possibly lemon flavor. Does have a nice complete flavor and good carbonation.

      " 3.5Served in 16oz. pint glass with lemon at my favorite place for pie in Newberg OR.Appearance: Bright hazy yellow with two fingers of frothy head that is very tenacious. A great looking American Wheat. Cloudy to the extreme.Smell: A bit thin I must say. Bready wheats ripe fruits and now that I think about it I smell the bubble gum that Jason says he smells. Taste: Well balanced with lighter medium body. You get a real citrus tone to begin and toasty breads in the middle. I get some of the banana fruitiness that you look for in a real hefe but its a bit thin for the real hardcore advocates of this style.There is also a real spiciness to it that sticks in the finish-- dry fruit as is warms. Overall: Lets face it American Wheats being called \"hefeweizens\" are an underwhelming beer style as it is. However I think that sometimes our palates have been so overwhelmed by IPAs and DIPAs that we miss out on the simplicity of this beer style. This is an excellent example of this style. Recommended if you're into it. Nevertheless I really could go for a big tall pilsner glass of one of these on a hot summer day. And of course WITH LEMON! 1157 characters paxchristi \n",

      " 4poured from the bottle into a Widmer Brothers Hefeweizen glassA - Pours a hazy gold with a hint of orange. Numerous bubbles rise in streams to the dense slightly off-white two finger head. Head is gone 3/4ths down the glass. Leaves behind an intricate web of lacing on the top half of the glass. S - Strong smell of sweet wheat malt with some hints of banana and orange. T - Sweet wheat malt upfront. The body of the beer is slightly overpowered by a good does of peppy hops while lemon orange and banana flavors swirl around in the background. Dry fruity finish. M - Light bodied with high carbonation suites the beer well. I believe this is the Widmer Brothers most popular beer (based in the banners/signs I see for it in bars across the country). It was hoppier than most other hefeweizens i've had which I consider to be good thing. Goes down easy and has potential as a session beer. Overall while not phenomenal I found this beer to be on par with the other high quality offerings from the brewery. 1021 characters Bockrules \n",

A: One finger head of decent cream and good thickness. Retention is good. Colour is a hazy orange. Textbook hefeweizen appearance - which is a good thing. Sm: Orange peel citrus ester hops. Light cream. Maybe some lemon esters. A moderate strength aroma. T: A musty barley foundation with orange peel citrus esters atop and maybe a touch of lemon. No malt taints the balance thankfully. It's decently built for the style and balanced to boot. It isn't complex but most beers in the style (at least that I've had are rather simplistic. It's a few hairs shy of refreshing. Mf: Smooth and wet - and just as well. Dr: Very drinkable albeit a tad overpriced. Still has some lessons to learn from the Germans before it's truly a brill hefeweizen.

Definitely in the American wheat style but has a little substance to it. As it warms a touch of malt emerges. A modest but distinct hop flavors gives it a little boost.

Lots of different flavors (not necessarily good) in first taste. Not that carbonated. Taste was quick to go away and the aftertaste wasn’t that great. Maybe more wheat in the aftertaste? Taste didn’t get better as the beer went down. I suppose it would be much better with a lemon or an orange but can we really call it a good beer when it needs additional flavor?

      " 3Appearance - Pours out very cloudy like a true German unfiltered hefeweizen. The color is a darker yellow or almost a straw. Sadly the head from a tap pour dissipated rather quickly. Smell - Not a lot off this beer. I swirled it around a lot to get some aroma of wheat and a very small amount of banana.Taste - Crisp carbonation up front with some wheat and bready tastes. The flavors are not strong and dissipate quickly off the tongue. Since there's not a lot of aroma breathing in while drinking doesn't seem to add much to the taste. My thought is that it falls flat in its attempt to replicate a German style Hefe. Definitely an American Wheat in design.Drink - The beer is a 4.9% ABV so it's certainly a sessionable beer. Especially so with a lighter flavor profile. The beer is highly decorated from the Beer Cup and Great American Beer Festival so I was a little shocked with how underwhelmed I was with the beer.

      " 3.5Poured into an antique pils glass.Pours with a bountiful white billowy head that caps a cloudy pale orange body.Smells of slightly biting grassy hops and a bit of malts (not noticeably wheat malt). More hoppy in the nose than I expected with the character of those hops being more astringent than I expected as well.This almost could be a hoppier blonde ale expect for the smooth maltiness imparted by the wheat. Overall rather fresh and pleasing flavors very appropriate for summer tastes. The hops are not complex and taste a bit uniform and generic but are still tasty and fairly clean. Bitterness on the tongue is muted and the malts make a showing (without being especially remarkable). There is a quenching dryness to this beer that is pleasing.The mouthfeel is carbonated to an appropriate level and is overall on the light side of medium bodied. Goes down without leaving much aftertaste or any other feeling in the mouth.Conclusion: This beer is much better than expected from the raitings. This isn't world class but it is a solid summer-style offering with a particularly quenching quality. Bear in mind however that this isn't a hefeweizen. I find it a bit shameful that an American company labels its beer as something that it clearly isn't. 1272 characters allforbetterbeer \n",

      " 2.512 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. Bottled on Feb. 16 so definitely at the end of its shelf life. Pours a cloudy orange-yellow with one finger of lumpy foam. No carbonation evident. Decent lacing. Nose of sweet malt and a little yeast. A little bit of banana. Supple mouthfeel with no carbo. Lightly syrupy not heavy. Palate shows a bit of banana but is too sweet to be as refreshing as the really good hefs. I'm sure this presents better when it is fresher but as it is it makes a decent little session beer. The chicks at your next party will dig it. 558 characters hoppyhampy \n",

Very slight muskiness in the taste.

      " 3Sampled on May 17 2011. The place where I had this on tap served it to me with a lemon wedge firmly attached to the rim of the glass without checking with me first. So my impressions are already marred by the lemon aroma wafting from the murky cloudy pale yellow pour. I got a little wheat but the lemon took over everything. The body was light and the taste had wheat and grains with a touch of tart hops. There are better ones out there. 441 characters puboflyons \n",

Pale malt wheat lemon and light spice.Taste is mostly the same opening with weak flavors of mostly wheat and slight graininess lemon herbal and some orangey spice. Unlike many American wheat beers this improved alot with warmth.A bit of a spiky mouthfeel but not too bad decent body to it. As expected 'hefeweizen' is misleading this is an American wheat all the way. Really bland until it warms a bit and becomes alright doesn't get much further than that.

Some wheat and hops thats about it.T&M - Light and refreshing body good carbonation no too much wheat not to much yeast nice use of hops and very easy to drink.O - A good wheat beer. I wouldn't mind having this again.This was a hit on my Widmer sampling their beers are so far 2:1 in my opinion. Their Rotator IPA was terrible all hop no malt still tasted green it was a miss for me. I did notice the false advertisement on this one after the first sip which I wasn't too disappointed about for I do not care too much for Hef's. This beer was perfect for me I don't like Hef's aftertaste I feel theres almost too much wheat. In this beer I felt the balance was spot on this is definitely an American style beer easy drinkin and simple as toast. Probably wouldn't consider this to be too exotic their Drifter Pale Ale is pretty well crafted for those looking for the brewery's better brews. Despite all the \"Hooplah\" its a pretty good drinker feels like a more flavorful BMC. Excellent Lawnmower beer. Stay thirsty my friends! 1134 characters NickRivers \n",

      " 4Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass.Ah time to try the much maligned Widmer \"Hefeweizen.\" This is a pretty good looking beer it's a very hazy golden yellow color that's absolutely loaded with floaties. Head is a modest finger that retains fairly well. Aroma is average for the style (that being Pale Wheat not Hefeweizen) wheat and sharp lemon not too much else. Taste follows the nose. Lemon. Wheat. A touch of hoppiness. That's it. It's good. The mouthfeel is solid it's highly carbonated and goes down smooth. All said I like this. It's just a simple beer wheat hops and lemon. Nothing else. Perfectly drinkable and delicious. I could easily see people being pissed off buying this looking for a true Hefeweizen though. 741 characters shand \n",

      " 1.5Note: since this beer is labeled and marketed as a hefeweizen I'm reviewing it as a hefeweizen. If that's what the brewery says it is then they're inviting comparisons to other hefeweizens -- comparisons which are bound to be overwhelmingly negative.Appearance: A \"weizen pour\" from a 12-ounce bottle into one of my hefeweizen glasses reveals a straw-colored body yellowish-orange with a hint of tannish-brown. A scant one-finger head recedes almost immediately leaving a filmy cap and no lacing during the course of drinking. Sadly this is the beer's strong suit.Smell: Faintly soapy although even that is a stretch. This beer has very little aroma of any kind good or bad. If I really use my imagination I can detect a hint of West Coast hops -- a smell that doesn't belong in a hefeweizen. None of the typical hefeweizen aromas (banana bread clove) are present.Taste: This is the worst hefeweizen I've ever had. I imagine Bud Light Golden Wheat might be similar to this although Widmer's hefeweizen packs an unsettling punch of citric/piney hop character. Since discernible hoppiness is out of keeping with the style though that's not really a good thing. The predominant flavor is of hops-infused water with a fleeting memory of wheaty tang (the bad semi-rotten kind) and some sort of nondescript powder blended in -- the latter probably due to the yeast suspended in the beer. The clove/banana/bubble gum/bread esters that define the hefeweizen style are nowhere to be found.Mouthfeel: Slick slippery thin and watery bolstered only by the dead yeast's contribution of some palate-clinging chalkiness. This is an awful hefeweizen with none of the vibrant carbonization or creamy yeastiness one would expect from the style.Overall: Again this is the worst hefeweizen I've ever had. If it were an American wheat ale (a style I dislike) maybe it would score somewhat better per style expectations. But if it's a hefeweizen (as it allegedly is based on the label) it sucks. It's not the soul-crushingly bad experience that say Sam Adams Triple Bock is but it is a pitiful worthless hefeweizen. 2130 characters UGADawgGuy \n",

Smells of yeast lemon and faint hops. It tastes very grainy and wheaty. A bit watery with a dry finish. Lacks any kind of originality to set it apart from other wheats.

      " 3.5This beer is an American style wheat beer typical of what you'd find at a local pub or microbrewery/eatery that does their own in-house brewing. It's nothing special mind you but it is a good enough beer for cheap to replace the corn-based trash out there. The \"hefeweizen\" on the label is marketing nonsense but beyond that it's a real wheat beer.NOTE:For people like myself who have problems with corn-based beer this is about as inexpensive as wheat beer gets. Think of it a MGD with a wheat taste to it and you'll be fine. Sometimes you just don't want a dark and bitter wheat beer. Alcohol content is spot-on with typical American and Mexican beers like MGD Corona and so on - perfect for get-togethers or with a hot dog or pizza. 748 characters Plekto \n",

The head is white and about two fingers tall with decent retention and lacing at best.A hint of yeast in the aroma but mostly a heavy grain scent.

Just a touch of pepper and bubble gum from the yeast but you have to work hard to get it. There is a hint of American hops floating around also.Light fairly crisp body.If this is supposed to be a hefeweizen it misses by a large margin.

On top sits a modest one inch tall collar of creamy white foam.

From there it adds some citrusy orange and lemon character as well as some very slight bubble gum and banana. (The classic Hefeweizen bubble gum/banana notes are much thinner than I would like to see.) It then finishes with some dry spice and a nice balance of leafy hop bitterness. The palate is fairly crisp and very quaffable.Notes: As a Hefeweizen it is average but as an American Wheat Ale it is very well made. 977 characters generallee \n",

Not a bad nose but its not getting me too exited either.Wheat and mild hoppiness hit the pallet first. Further sips reveal a subtle spicy clove flavor. Seems more pale wheat ale than hef. Nothing particularly wrong with the flavor I would go as far as to call it tasty. Boring for sure but tasty none the less.Medium body. The carbonation is bordering on the edge of soday but it holds together ok.WB Hefeweizen is a decent drink.

A corn husk is all that is keeping this from being called \"Widmer Lite\" and it really fails to live up to the hefeweizen name.

The beer disappears the second it goes down your throat.M: Far too wispy and light even for the style.

      " 3[Best served in a Weizen glass]It poured a hazy medium yellow with an amber hue and had a small (less than 1 finger) white frothy head that was mostly diminishing and had fair lacing. The aroma was of light grain malts a grassy hop and a nice strong earthy yeast with a hint of citrus and cloves. It tasted bitter-sweet in the beginning with a nice citrus note. It then proceeded to have a light hoppy finish with a dose of spice at the end. The flavor stayed with you for an average amount of time leaving almost no taste of the brew a few minutes after the swallow. Mouthfeel was creamy yet watery in texture and medium in body with a lively carbonation. Overall a decent wheat beer and would be great as a session beer. It’s a light refreshing brew and nice served with a slice of lemon. But nothing really stands out to make this beer anything overly special. 876 characters KajII \n",

      " 3.5Well for starters it is very cloudy like a wheat beer should be. The color is yellow maybe a tiny bit of orange. It looks very thin though it doesn't look like your going to be able to pick up the wheat even though it's cloudy it looks weak and thin. I like my wheat beers to have a nice heavy wheat presence. Poured a one finger head that has faded pretty quickly. Appearance is eh ok. Well on the smell I like the fact that the fruity smell isn't overpowering that is good but I hope it isn't too subdued on the flavor a little fruit taste is good in a hefe. You can also pick up malts a crisp malt smell. Not really any hops here tho that's ok though for the style. Nope taste is not that great. The first thing I notice is that generic beer taste like a macro lager has. It is very thin on the mouth like I thought it would be maybe a tiny bit bigger than I anticipated but still very thin not much wheat presence. You hardly pick up any fruit taste in this beer kinda disappointing too much is bad but I like a little in these wheat beers. I mean there isn't anything too offensive about this beer other than maybe that generic beer taste but at the same time there is really NOTHING that good about it. Like I mentioned before it is very thin and by thin I mean thin on the mouth so mouthfeel is not good on this beer. Drinkability is ok I guess not a heavy beer. Overall super average nothing impressive here at all. 1451 characters MaltsOfGlory \n",

      " 4.5A solid enjoyable example of the American Hefeweizen. Just enough flavor and nuances to intrigue the craft beer enthusiast but not too much to dissuade a mass market lager drinker from trying and enjoying craft beer. Appearance:A frothy white head caps this cloudy dirty gold brew. Nice lacing. Smell:Fruity tart citrus especially lemon and some pineapple. Overall very pleasant though a bit mild. Bready notes appear as the beer warms. Taste:Tangy and tart balanced with a spritzy mouthfeel. Somewhat dry finish with some hints of bread. Drinkability:Excellent thought the higher carbonation hurts it a little. 632 characters birdypowder \n",

      " 3.5Widmer \"Hefeweizen\" - 12 ounce bottle (dated 11/08/10) poured into a chalice just to continue the theme of misrepresenting the style. Pardon my bias; I jest. The pour yields a finger-tall bone white head that hangs out for a bit before disappearing like a ninja; however a small amount of lacing does remain. The beer is a rich golden shade bordering on orange. Haziness is to style but despite swirling the last bit of beer around the bottle before the final pour there is a bit of chunky sediment suspended in the glass.The scent is very yeasty one might even say doughy. Mild orange citrus aroma can be noted as well as clove. Wheat is faint in the nose and is overtaken by a metallic odor emerging on the tail-end. The taste confirms that this beer is not so much hefeweizen as it is American pale wheat ale. The hefeweizen misnomer is confirmed by the lack of several defining characteristics of the style: most notably the signature banana flavors. Misnomers aside Widmer uh wheat beer is crisp and a little bitter up front. Wheat beer flavors begin emerging slowly on the tongue. The wheat comes first followed by some more bitter off-flavors and a surprisingly strong alcohol presence for a beer of 4.9% ABV. The mouthfeel is a bit off for any style of wheat beer. The carbonation level is inappropriately high even for the style and really lightens up what should be a medium bodied beer. It just isn't helping this beer's cause at all.In spite of its flaws this is a wheat beer that is still drinkable. It's readily available and reasonably priced. The ABV is relatively low. The taste and mouthfeel though not outstanding are not offensive. All said Widmer Hefeweizen is a pretty run of the mill wheat beer but one could do worse.---The Two-Schlitz Scale: (see my profile for an explanation) Ich glaube nicht geben einen Schlitz für Widmer Hefeweizen. 1895 characters weizenbob \n",

      " 2.5Years ago back in Escondido my sister swore by this beer referring to it (as did many others) as hefeweizen (with no brewery designation). It was served at more than one of her pool parties softball games and get togethers (though thankfully not at her wedding where we were treated to the long lost Blind Pig Golden Ale). With nostalgia on my mind I decided to try this one again and much to my surprise it did not impress me in the least.Widmer pours a lovely cloudy golden orange into my proper hefeweizen glass. Orange yeast and cinnamon hits my nose before gliding down my throat. Lemon mingles with the orange and lightly bitter hop spice to add a bit of tartness to the hefe. Easily drinkable there is a bit of chewy yeasty wheat goodness which lasts throughout the beer. A hefty body to carry the orange lemon rind zest and hop spice zing which encompasses the Widmer Hefeweizen. Hazy yellow color a little citrus no noticeable banana or clove aromas/flavors. Drinkable to be certain and obviously Americanized (for better or worse) this one left me feeling indifferent maybe a bit nostalgic for the middle nineties in SoCal when it was all about Social D Sierra Nevada (or Blind Pig/Sam Adams/AleSmith ESB/hefeweizen/Portland Brewing etc) and a good place to party for the night maybe a bit sad that this beer still retains the popularity which it does.

Just nothing outstanding.Feel wise it was again quite typical tho a bit dry for the style. Light bodied and ample carbonation led to a decent feel for this beer. Very average for the style.

      " 4Many Hef fans might be surprised by the fact that this beer tastes nothing like a traditional German Hef. But as far as American style Hefs go this beer is decent. It has a nice gold color and a nice cloudy appearance. There are a lot of citrus and floral characteristics on the nose. The head is decent... not great like the other hefs out there. The fruity citrus flavor gives this beer a lot of versatility. While I find most Hefs best drunk on its own Widmer Hef can be paired with a wide range of foods. I especially like it with burgers and fries. It also goes well with fried calamari pizza and mozzarella sticks. The versatility of this Hef sets it apart from the others.

Nice!T - Kind of more bitter than I expected for the malt and the flavors don't really shine through very well but it is enjoyable. Mild if any banana flavoring.M - Light and crisp. Pretty good.D - Well I like other reps of the style and this one kind of falls flat. Still worth at least a B rating in my book. 451 characters DrDemento456 \n",

      " 1.5On tap at Ten Mile StationBollocks I say. This ain't no hefeweizen. While hazy like one should be and even with a deceivingly dense head with great retention and moderate lacing the nose belies this beers emasculated nature. While banana and a little clove are present the balance and character of this beer does not remotely resemble its forebearers. It's much like comparing a McDonald's burger to a real burger just because beef salt and maybe a little pepper are present it doesn't mean this is particularly acceptable. Light and watery on the palate this beer is rather disappointing. Yes it has a little bread some banana and a little clove but this is not what I was looking for. As described this is watery and the finish is dry a little fruity and rather disappointing. I don't have as developed palate for wine but I had a lot more fun deconstructing the better than average pinot noir and cabernet sauvignon that were also served at the time. This beer OTOH was disappointing. 1006 characters DefenCorps \n",

Not much smell besides sweet fruity malts.Rather plain taste there is some bitterness up front which is odd. Sweet malts a bit like an apple or pear mixed with bread. No banana present.

Nice looking hefe.S: Mild grains on the front with a banana presence and plenty of sourdough notes throughout. A trailing citrus presence is barely detectable.T: Refreshing and light with an almost creamy mouthfeel. Lemon zest hints in the finish. Better without a lemon in it for that reason. A decent hefe taste a little grainy overall.D: Very drinkable. They serve it in a lot of bars for a reason; it's a nice 'introduction to hefeweizen' beer. Not too complex but if you like this I'd delve deeper into the world of unfiltered wheat ales.Value: I think this is a great deal for what you get. I paid six dollars for a sixer a buck a beer.

Not a lot of lacing left behind.Aroma was pretty bland. Mostly just a bit of yeasty aroma rolling off this one.Taste was also a bit underwhelming. Not much that's hefeweizen like here at least nothing like a German hefe. Very yeasty taste but not German yeasty -- none of those interesting phenols & esters just yeasty.

Not much to it rather simple and pretty bland. Mouthfeel: Light to medium with active carbonation. Drinkability: Goes down OK but this beer just isn't doing it for me.

I read some of the reviews once I got home and saw such descriptors as skunky and undrinkable and I have to disagree. I have to say that this is not nearly as good as many of the wheat beers out there but I would say this is refreshing and goes down smooth.

Under the light this Hef is the color and texture of pineapple juice topped by a head of pure white. Some visible carbonation and some floating sediment. Bubbles atop seem a different consistency from the liquid like oil and water. Almost like saliva. Unappetizing. Visible bubbles. Hazy. Milky. A little bit of spattered lacing but it's not enough to save this one. Graininess. Pale Malt. Rice. Slight dry wheat. Rye. Unexpectedly light akin to a light lager. Again the taste of an adjunct lager overpowers. Wheat is there but with none of the richness I want. the faintest hint of sweet banana yeast. Dry finish. Super-high carbonation bordering on painful like toothpaste. Medium body smooth.In the realm of wheat beers I'd call this the chaff.

This is ok but is way too mild overall for my liking. Not that I would expect a hefeweizen to necessarily be huge but this is simply too weak comparatively.Light and crisp easy going. Carbonation is ok.The drinkability is ok but there are so many others that offer much bigger flavors. Make this a double hef and you'd probably have something really good. 603 characters ujsplace \n",

Only recognizable scents are lemony citrus and a little wheat.Taste: Mostly in line with the smell. There was none of the biscuity yeast taste. It just takes like someone took a light wheat beer and mized it with unsweetened lemonade. If you let it warm even a bit it just gets even more lacking and has a very watery characteristic.Mouthfeel: Its light. Super light. Highly carbonated. I gave it a good rating but to be honest its just average. Nothing really of note.Drinkability: It goes down easy. And I imagine it would be very refreshing on a hot day. I take enjoyability into account however and I truly did not enjoy drinking this beer.Overall: I love hefes. One of my favorite beers. Especially to eat with a nice dinner. They are light and the typical flavors can really enhance foods like chicken and salads with a nice cirtus based dressing. However I was really let down by this beer. IMO it doesn't even belong in the hefe style. 1374 characters myost88 \n",

      " 3Purchased from Perry's liquor store in Athens GA.When I brought the six-pack home I was so excited that I immediately cracked one open. I poured it into an appropriate wheat beer glass. The appearance at first was fairly attractive with a nice straw color and a cloudiness characteristic of an unfiltered wheat beer. The head left something to be desired and as I drank I discovered that the head did not retain nor leave lacing. Despite my attempts at awakening the head (indeed I'd poured hard to start) the head refused to be more than a few tiny bubbles on the surface.When I smelled the beer I got a faint hint of wheat and some spices butl I also smelled the same skunkiness one would get from a light adjunct American lager... It was below average at best.The moment the beer touched my lips I knew I was disappointed with the purchase. I tasted some wheat sure. Unfortunately the flavor seemed watered-down and the aforementioned skunkiness carried through to the taste. Perhaps I've been spoiled with wonderful belgian wheats from our local pub. Maybe I think that Blue Moon or Sierra Nevada Wheat is a far superior alternative for nearly the same price. Perchance I am angry that my Hefeweizen tasted like Bud Light (or worse) mixed with Blue Moon minus most of the spice notes. I don't know but this beer goes on the \"never again\" list.What does it need? A stronger flavor profile would help. The watery taste is far too overwhelming. Some nice body with a decent head would help too. Increasing the thickness by a touch would not only improve mouthfeel but also head retention. I suppose for the price it is alright but as I mentioned before there are more flavorful alternatives out there. 1729 characters mindmage625 \n",

Crisp and light bodied with good carbonation.D - I don't think the beer has gone bad due to a) not being skunked and b) not being old. I was hoping for a good hefe instead I got a drain pour.

      " 3.512 oz bottle poured into a weizen glass.A- Looking at the head of this beer it certainly is not a hefeweizen. Small head with little retention and lacing. Hazy yellow color maybe a little orange color as well.S- Strong citrus smell most notably a lemon scent and with small tones of orange. Sweetness of the malt very evident.T- Not surprising that the lemon comes out the strongest in the beer in the beer. Maybe those a slight orange taste as I noticed in the smell as well. Sweet beer but fruit sweet rather than a sugary candy sweet. Certainly this is not a hefe missing a lot of the key elements of the beer style I know this is considered an American Pale Wheat though.M- Thing smooth mouthfeel that fits pretty well for a summer day on the deck.D- Easy to drink this beer and not a bad wheat beer.Once again this is not a hefe as it is advertised. I knew there would some difference in the taste as it is an American version but this is nothing more than an American Pale Wheat Ale. 1009 characters Lolli1315 \n",

      " 4.5Figured I should give this beer a review seeing how it was one of the first good beers I tried and essentially became my \"gateway\" beer into the world of craft brew.Serving type: On tapAppearance - Pours a golden cloudy color with minor foam retention. Expected of the style.Smell - Wheat hops and a citrus character.Taste - Wheaty and malty but with a slightly assertive hop character and lemon notes. Although considered beer blasphemy to some this is one of those beers I do drink with the lemon in it although I avoid this practice with the German hefeweizens. Medium carbonation.Mouthfeel - A medium bodied beer with medium carbonation. Crisp refreshing and a bit of a dry finish.Drinkability - A very sessionable beer for sure. Perfect with food or for a night out.Overall a pretty solid offering. I do prefer Bavarian style Hefs but this a solid go-to beer for me when I want something to wash down food with or am just hanging out at a bar and want something lighter and more refreshing than the beers I usually drink. Not amazing but blows any adjunct lager out of the water. I give it a flat B. 1136 characters Flightoficarus \n",

      " 2.5I sampled this on-tap at the Strawberry Music Festival beer tent. There's little in the nose the colour is lacking there's little body and a disappointingly bland flavour. My standard for the style is Hoegaarden being the first wheat beer I sampled all those years ago in Nottingham. The Widmer comes nowhere near even close.There's barely any malt either in the nose or the taste neither was there any of the warm spicy citrus I've come to expect from the type. It's a thin brew in every respect and in fact the only good thing I can say is that it was cold and wet. Not unpleasant just bitterly disappointing.No hops little malt and barely any nose. Sadly I was not impressed.(Some of this review is cross-posted on my blog.) 744 characters wertperch \n",

      " 3A mediocre and not very inspiring wheat ale. The beer pours a slightly cloudy dirty water yellow color with slight clove aroma. There are some sweet malts present in the nose but they are hard to pick out. The look of the beer is so so it had a decent white head that faded very quickly and there isn't much left but the dirty yellow with just a tiny rim around the glass. The taste is rather uninteresting. There is a slight lemony citrus bite throughout but there is nothing particularly sweet about it there are no clove or banana flavors it is pretty bland as it hits the mid section and the finish. The beer is reasonably refreshing but the taste just vanishes by the time it hits the back of the tongue. This beer is like vaporware. The lemony citrus just disintegrates and there's not much left over. Very average beer. 833 characters albern \n",

In that regards it is pretty disappointing but even compared within the American wheat ale category this one comes out watery flat and very macro in flavor. I can't help but think that this recipe could use an update to increase it's flavor complexity and bring it more in line with contemporary expectations.That said for pairing with food where the food would overpower the palate and ruin a truly good brew this probably fits. If you are looking for something to gulp while downing salty snacks or that bacon cheeseburger this is alright. For drinking on its own look elsewhere. 651 characters blackc5 \n",

I rank the drinkability high in that if you are looking for a light beer that isn't feeling and doesn't taste like swill this is your ticket.

The wheat flavor gives the beer a good earthy taste. Also has a tangerine flavor as well.I nice well balanced Hefeweizen and enjoyable beer. The fruit flavor has a nice tangy but easy drinking feel.

      " 3.5I picked up a sixer of this at Trader Joe's to celebrate the start of Mariners baseball I remember enjoying Hefewiezen on-tap back in some of my old Washington state watering holes. I should note that I was saddened to come home and see that this batch was bottled back in November of '08 so that certainly should be kept in mind with this review. A: Beautiful cloudy copper small head but lacing persists.S: A little yeast a little citrus sourness. Aroma is very mild and is lacking some of the traditional banana/clove/bubblegum smell.T: Taste is sadly pretty bland. A little sourness a little \"mustiness\" and a bit of sweetness. Again lacking the nuances of superior wheat-beers.M: Dry crisp and a little thin.D: Goes down pretty easy but mild and \"off\" flavors don't make it very compelling.I'd be interested in trying this again if it were more fresh but as it stands I can think of a half-dozen better wheat beers I'd take over this. 958 characters KBomb \n",

      " 3.512 oz bottle into a pint - looks like May 08 vintage.A - Gold in color. Very hazy - lots of yeast floating around. Head formation was very light and only left a very small film. Carbonation isn't greatly apparent.S - Okay this it the first time I would say I am actually say I am smelling skunk. It is downright nasty. T - Starts off with a little wheat astringency which builds with a hair of yeast bite in the mid-flavors. Finishes with a combination of that skunk flavor and a hair of almost honey sweetness.M - Moderate body - carbonation is the big driver of this with tends towards a biting texture. The beer itself is more thin as I swish it around. D - Seems easily drinkable - if this beer weren't like running over a skunk on the highway. Perhaps this one just has gone bad. ABV is manageable and wouldn't be much of an issue. I applaud the attempt to create a full flavored American wheat but this one isn't tripping my trigger. 954 characters katan \n",

A base of bready wheaty malt rests beneath mild lemon and zest as well some grassy hop notes toward the middle and back of the palate with a finish that is light and just a bit grainy and watery.Easily drinkable but a poorly-named product as it fails to reach its Germanic aspirations and doesn't even apply the use of the famed Bavarian Hefeweizen yeast leaving it without any of the spicy complexity of its brethren across the Atlantic. 865 characters superdedooperboy \n",

Nice overall hefeweizen character.Smell: Aroma is immediately identifiable as a wheat brew. Nice and wheat yeasty bread with some minor citrus overtones. Very pleasant malt presence.Taste: The traditional smooth creamy wheat of hefeweizen comes out immediately. The flavor is a little subdued and there is a distinct lack of the usual sweetness. Replacing the usual sweetness is a very pleasant hop mixed with malt. There is also a slight banana essence is midflavor.Mouthfeel: This brew is not bouncy...in fact it sits a little flat. The carbonation is fine but the creamy character seems to just fill the palate and not clear well.Drinkability: As mentioned earlier the flatness of the flavor does not really encourage volume consumption but this is somewhat alleviated by the rather lightness of the recipe...expecially for a hefeweizen which is usually very filling.

But it's enough to keep on drinking it.Leaves the mouth wanting more. Not too dry at all but sweet and earthy.High marks for drinkability. One of the easiest beers to drink. Back when it came out as a more popular bottled beer... I could easily put away a 12 pack to myself.Usually served with a lemon from tap.

Light aroma of dry wheat no clove banana or citrus notes of any kind. The first bottle I poured gingerly down an angled glass because a hefe usually foams like mad if you're not cautious. This one however I soon learned I had to force straight down the middle \"glugging\" it if you will just to get a respectable head. Nice color no lacing. I swirled the \"yeast\" like one should and was rewarded with floaties and chunks...no thanks. Crisp and somewhat refreshing it's not creamy as it needs to be. Flavor is essentially malt and wheat no more no less. This one should be ashamed to call itself a hefe in fact it's not even a very good example of an American Wheat and that's hard to accomplish. 893 characters kinger \n",

A half inch of head that holds magnificently very good lacing.To hard to see carbonation. Smells of musty malt with wheat bread. Along with some sweet bubble gum aroma. Spicy floral citrus hop notes as well .As it warms a cooked vegetable aroma develops (Kind of weird)Taste/Mouthfeel - Tastes of rich sweet honey wheat bread & malt. Followed by citrus notes that come in just before a floral hopy finish. Hop bitterness lingers a tad as well. Very balanced very wheaty maybe a touch of clove. Not much change as it warms. Mouthfeel is thick chewy & full bodied with medium carbonation.Drinkability/Final thoughts - I would be able to enjoy about 2-3 of these. When I feel like a rich full bodied beer this is one style that i turn to. I love the lingering hops in this version its very good. One thing I thought was strange was the vegetable aroma that develops as it warms. Its not offensive just strange & out of place for the style.Its still very good though I recommend you give it a try. Cheers! 1121 characters PintOHops \n",

Taste almost like a malty american light beer with yeast.M - Watery except for the slight character given by the yeast.D - I could drink a few of these. Not really bad just nothing good about it.

Seems kinda odd to have a BA C+ average being kind of a flagship and all.Amber orange with a good haziness. Soapy looking froth. Gritty grain aroma. Yeasty wheat lemon pledge sweetness.The hefe spice is fairly uniquel and definitly tasty but overall it's just prettyt bland. The spice seems tacked on. Some nutty malt and a bit of lemon in there too. Decent drinkabiltiy but gets a bit skuzzy when it warms. 565 characters SurlyDuff \n",

A little sweet then the malt.Mouthfeel - Not as much body as the aforementioned cider but not terrible either.Drinkability - I mean I could drink several.

Taste is fairly clean drying grain and very little else. Body is about par for a hefe and the carbonation is medium.This seems to be a fairly simple non-complex brew and I could appreciate it for its crispness in the summer but it really doesn't hold a candle to the other hefeweizens on the market.Thanks to Shadman for this brew. 625 characters bobsy \n",

Minimal head that disappears quicker than I blow it.S - Strong honey scent with orange and actually a little malty. Smells and looks yummy at this point.T - A sheet Houston we've got a problem. It tastes like Bud Light. Actually it tastes like Budweiser ya know the \"heavy stuff\" I wanted a freakin' wheat beer and what happened to the honey and orange.

      " 3My second pour at the Prudential Center Newark NJ for the Devils/Islanders game. I was quite happy to see a west coast craft brewry on tap and a heffeweizen to boot! I've had Widmer in the past when in Seattle for the tulip festival and didn't remember much so this was a good time to give it another go.A: The fine lass a Bronx woman I might add poured a foggy dark orange into a quality plastic stadium pint cup with the foggyness around the edges. Bigboy dark creamy rich two finger head falling quickly thereafter to a small cap. Impressive sticky legs turning to crescnts as it reached the cap. A good start as compared to the see through versions you mostly get from American brewers.S: As this is a Porland brew (I've done my homework on the ingredients as well as knowing a chef in the city that has had this on tap for years) the multiple malts mixture had me intrigued. Pre-expectations can be the killer I reckon because I didn't smell any of what I would consider to be basic tenants of a Heffe such as yeast banana and cloves. Mostly pale malts and spices was what I got after multiple nose dives. T: I was positive the woman served me the wrong beer after my first quaf. A few more gingerly sipps and I looked over to my friend and asked him if this was an IPA or a wheat. The classification does not lie with Pale and Ale with Wheat in the middle to confuse. Your pallet gets smashed with classic west coast hop bomb with just about each drink. Now mind you there are minor accents of cloves and spices but almost as an afterthought or simply to comply with the style ingredients. Too much malt with four of them you could argue this was nearing a Quad but easily an American Wheat Ale more than anything else. To reiterate there are copious amounts of malts (Cascade) and even more hops in this brew which is not bad to set the record straight just too much and more bitterness than I would prefer.M: Nedium mouthfeel with a powerful carbonation level and retention but works well due to the over abundance of malts. ABV level is not overpowering and a good brew for a hot day in the yard or a day long festival.D: The Widmer brothers can lay claim to one of the oldest American Wheats around and heffe I reckon. Again this is a malt/hop influenced Heffe and another good example of the West coast amalgam of styles and ingredients. An enjoyable drink and one I would recommend to IPA gents not fond of Heffe's due to banana/yeast flavors (which this one lacks for the most part) 2520 characters Brianmerrilyn \n",

      " 2.5Thanks to Rich for the opportunity to sample this beer. Served at just over fridge temperature in a weissbier glass this has the date 061808 raised on the label. This East Coast example was bottle at Redhook.Appearance- A heavily cloudy murky gold beer glugs into the glass... this is as opaque as any hefeweizen I've seen. The head rises two fingers and stays put for many minutes lacing well. Smell- While the wheat malt and aromatic hops are present the usual components of banana bubblegum and clove are almost completely obscured... if not absent. The nose is one of lemon wheat and doughy bread. Taste- Husky and wheaty in flavor this beer goes straight to grain and barely offers up the truly enjoyable attributes of a weissbier. There is no banana no clove but a spiciness and hop bittering comes through in the finish. Disappointing.Mouthfeel/Drinkability- A thin beer that struggles to becomes slick and creamy... the carbonation is easy and nondescript providing a mild texture without emphasizing the ingredients. Overall I'd suggest passing this over completely in favor of the real deal from Germany or several other offerings from the States. 1177 characters yelterdow \n",

      " 3.5It's currently 7 in the morning on a Saturday I'm finishing up a magnum of Lost Abbey Red Barn following a Bomber of Mojo Risin' Double IPA after a 12 hour late night at work and now I'm reviewing a beer from notes I REALLY need to go to bed but I'm contemplating just going down to McDonald's for some breakfast instead. The beer was served on-tap at the Saucer in a Widmer Hefeweizen Weizen glass that was mine to keep! The beer was served a hazy straw yellow with a thin diminishing head nothing like I'd expect from a Hefeweizen or an American Pale Wheat Ale. Aroma was nearly textbook for the style; sweet fruits bananas and bubblegum. The taste was more of the same sweet fruits and sweet malts with the hops quietly doing their job in the background. The beer was light and smooth with decent carbonation also textbook for the style. This is certainly a great example of what this style should be. While I'm not a huge fan of the style if the mood should strike or if I want to use my glass I may purchase this one again. 1039 characters atsprings \n",

Smell was faint and not what I expected- sort of a nutty earthy almost sour scent. Taste also wasn't expected. No citrus flavors. Just a quick flat wheat followed by a monotonous bitterness.

      " 3.5Poured into my favorite weizen glass. A very pitiful head for a hefeweizen. Very little lace and no staying power whatsoever. The limp head can be forgiven though when I notice that this is one of the \"messiest\" weizens I've ever seen. I love it when brewers take the whole \"unfermented\" thing as far as it can go. The sediment floating around looks more like orange juice pulp than yeast and the consistency is very thick. Smell is very faint. Not really anything interesting there. As for taste...well it seems that the orange juice comment was right on the money. This is one of the most orangy tasting weizens I've ever had. Mostly citrus some spice. Nothing too fancy here. Goes down pretty easy. A very meh kind of beer. Big points for the appearance though. 771 characters tlinner \n",

It gave off hints of citrus banana and wheat. The flavor pretty well followed the aroma. It had a good wheat flavor with hints of citrus. The main problem that I had with it was that it was over carbonated. Could have been the restaurant's fault. It had a medium body and was reasonably easy to drink.

      " 3.5Color is a substantial sunny yellow with a little bit of orange. Quite hazy with a white cap excluding the orange yeast that I accidentally poured when emptying the bottle. I've never seen that happen before where the yeast made a noticeable spot on the head.Smell is barely there. I get a little bit of wheat and malts and maybe with a bit of imagination some lemon and spice. But I think I'm searching for something that's not there.Taste is similar. I don't mind the taste but it just doesn't have much to it. Hefes aren't my common choice but the few I've had other than Widmer have much more interesting flavors primarily coming from the yeast. I've heard there's debate about this beer being more of an American pale wheat ale. I'd prefer to call it that it seems less pretentious.All in all though I really don't mind drinking this beer. The feel is pleasing and smooth. It goes down easily and encourages you to crack open another. There is a reason this is so much of a crossover beer. Hopefully it'll steer more people to some of the much more worthy beers of the style. 1098 characters josiahschlender \n",

Expected more from a wheat beer in terms of head retention-was good for a small amount of time then it just died. Lacing looks pretty good though.Nose: Pretty neutral in aroma. Some slight spicy hop notes come through. Wheat malt is detectable overall nice malt background here nice mix of wheat and barley. This is however nothing to brag about. As I said it is pretty neutral-pretty weak in aroma.Tongue: Nice malty backbone however I don't think that it is balanced very well as there is just about no hop flavor or presence of bitterness to balance it out. Slight hop spice and a very low too low level of bitterness that leaves the palate slightly dry.Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Light in body with a nice level of carbonation just right for a hot summer day. Slightly dry finish sluggishly crisp-crisp with fat rounded edges. This isn't one that I'd go looking for I don't think that I'll really ever find myself buying this again.

      " 4Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. Appearance is almost orange in color quite hazy with almost no head. Head completely dissipated after taking one sip.Not much of a defining smell there is slight wheat smell and a very slight citrus smell but again you really have to try to smell the beer.Taste is surprisingly good. After the other reviews I read on here I didn't think it would be as good as it actually is - especially since I'm not a huge advocate of wheat beers. My refrigerator is unfortunately set pretty cold right now so maybe that affects the flavor but the beer goes down very smooth and when it's this cold it's hard to distinguish between the citrus flavors. I can almost certainly taste some lemon and another reviewer mentioned coriander which does seem to have a slight impact towards the middle-to-end of the beer.Again it's a very smooth beer - goes down like water. The citrus isn't tangy (or it was too cold to be tangy in my glass) and very very drinkable. There is nothing about this beer that's unique and would make it stand out however. It's a very middle-of-the-road beer that I would recommend to those who want to try this style for the first time. Super drinkable and for the inexpensive price certainly worth trying again. 1284 characters Ecliptica \n",

Taste is also faintly banana in nature. Not much else going on here. A slight swirl in the mouth reveals a little citrus or spicy note. Light bodied well carbonated. I'm left slightly dry after drinking half of this. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for a good example of this style but I'd push it on anyone who seemed interested in crossing over. 517 characters ZimZamZoom \n",

      " 3Poured from a bottle to a weizen glass. Had a light golden color and a somewhat thick texture. Also had a half inch head and no lacing.The smell was vaguely citrusy and wheaty but wasn't very well-defined. Had a lemon flavor along with the wheat but it was far too thin. Not much complexity. It isn't a terrible taste but not very good either.There's a low carbonation rate and an oily finish that make for a below average mouthfeel.Overall this is an uninteresting example of this style. It's not complex enough. Not a bad beer but doesn't rise above the fray. 576 characters avalon07 \n",

An okay head died down to nothing after it was poured. The scent of feces had died down once it was poured although it was still quite rancid.Tasted mildly citrusy and wheaty very light.

      " 4.5My rating here is higher than a lot of the others I have seen on this site. I am assuming it is because most Wheat Ales are not complex enough to rate highly in general or maybe because it is called a Hefeweitzen and is not really a traditional Hefe. Either way I think this beer is being underestimated.It is important to get it on tap. Widmer Hefeweitzen suffers more than most beers in the conversion to bottle. On tap (in a 32oz Masskrug) at the brewery it has a beautiful orange glow and the perfect cloudiness. The nose is a little weak not bad just not much there. The taste is filled with summer wheat and yeasty like fresh baked bread all complimented with a lot stronger hopps taste (although not so much smell) than most Hefe's.Maybe not the most fancy but a great every day beer. A Portlander's version of a Frenchman's Daily Bread. 855 characters JerryG \n",

      " 3.5Run of the mill American wheat beer. Looks like old orange juice. Cloudy brownish orange.Smell is mostly citrus and a bit herbal like tea. Taste starts similar to the smell. Citrus flavors mostly lemon and some tea like tastes as well. It's okay except for this hard to explain spicy flavor that takes over at the end. Not a big fan of that.The high carbonation leaves a dry crisp feeling washing away most of the bad aftertaste. It's one very redeeming quality of this beer making it fairly drinkable.This is kind of the McDonald's of Hefeweizen's.

I like Hefewezens so I thought I would give this one a try.I poured this aggressively but could not coax much of a head out of it. The small head dissipated quickly. This is a cloudy yellow orange. The nose is mostly biscuit/bread with some citrus background. The taste is very hoppy for a weizen. This is backed up by citrus oil flavor. It reminds me of some of the Belgian hops flavors. There is some carbonated bite. It does have a nice aftertaste of citrus and hops.

Hefe not so much but here goes.A - Minimal head cloudy swirls and yeasty chunks flow through this deep golden-orange brew very pleasant looking.S - Not too much here citrus-like I swear it's pineapple but I highly doubt it.T - As said many times before this isn't a hefe per say but that doesn't mean it's bad. I rather enjoy it's lightly layered hops and citrus/wheat blend.M - Medium-full bodied and yet overly carbonated.D - High I'd say at most bars and events in this area it can be found and it's a definite shoe-in over any of the macros. It's fairly tasty and easy to consume. Could also serve as a gateway beer. 665 characters PhageLab \n",

Smells nothing like a traditional hefe bread smell stands out most. Taste is somewhat bland no real fruit characteristics that I could pick up at least.

Worth seeking out for a spectacular drinking experience?...No. I graduated high school in Oregon so it's cool that this brew is from the Northwest. Actually it's my first beer from Oregon sad to say as I've heard great things about OR breweries. Gotta try more and soon! So many beers so little time.

It had good head retention which left lots of lacing on the glass and a cloudy blonde body. The aroma was faint and the taste wasn't very exciting; it was a bit tart yeasty and finished hoppy. I liked the mouthfeel on it it was soft and gentle as in went down. I need to pick better wheat beers next time if I have the choice.

Wow what a difference time makes!) Update 1-10-08: Recently had some again on-tap. Still looks good but the aroma was blah and the feel was harsh and peppery.

      " 4On-tap at Copperfield’s in Warwick RI served in a US tumbler pint glass. A: The beer is a very light gold color with a short white head that fades quickly and leaves a thin lace on the glass. S: The aroma was heavy on the lemon along with a little bit of wheat spice & yeast. T: Much like in the smell the lemon was pretty dominant. The standard bready wheat flavor of the style was certainly there as well with a faint taste of hops. The lemon sweetness and some wheat flavor remained in the after-taste. M: Very smooth & crisp light-to-medium body medium-to-heavy carbonation clean finish. D: I picked this beer essentially by default because the five other choices that I had for draft beer were either beers that I’ve had before or watery macros. I thought AB had their hand in this one but I tried it anyway. I have to be honest and say that it was a pleasant surprise.

The appearance is slightly cloudy not good for what I expect out of a hefe. Smell is quaint nothing out of the ordinary. The taste is probably the high point of this beer. It's interesting for a hefe because it has a bitter note to it but its not smooth like it should be at the same time. Franziskaner has this nailed down. The mouthfeel is pretty decent I'll give it that. This is a good beer I'd use for bringing to a party because its cheap enough and different from the swill everyone else would be bringing.

      " 3.5Foggy orange-amber; more orange in the center and more foggy amber as the eye travels to the edge of the glass. The smallish cap is rich cream in color almost dark enough to be called ecru. It has a rough texture and look (which I like) and lays down a fair amount of sticky lace in the bargain. I like the unpolishedness of it all.The nose doesn't keep pace with the appearance and strikes me as pretty close to average. Even though four different malts have been used (wheat pale Munich and caramel) the beer takes its personality from the first of those; as it should given the style. Uncharacteristically though at least in terms of the best hefes there's almost no banana or clove. A hefe weizen without a good yeast strain is no kind of hefe weizen at all.Ditto the flavor. There's no question that this beer is much much closer to an American pale wheat ale than to a hefe weizen. Only a wee smidgen of clove spiciness keeps it from being a dead cert AmWheat. I'm not sure that a four-headed malt bill was all that necessary... and I still can't appreciate any Munich or caramel maltiness whatsoever.There's a moderate amount of hoppiness with lemon zest as the dominant hop-related flavor. Of the three varieties Alchemy (used for bittering never heard of it) Cascade and Willamette (used for aroma) the Cascade hops come through the loudest on the palate. Bitter trumps sour trumps sweet in the hierarchy of flavor sensations; an interesting take on the style.There's nothing really wrong with the mouthfeel. It's medium in heft with a minimum of wheaty lushness. The carbonation is just a bit spritzy but for some reason it works. Those bubbles along with the bitterness keep mouth interest at an acceptable level. Since the ABV clocks in at less than 5.0% this would be a decent session beer in the summer months.Widmer Brothers brags that Hefeweizen is 'America's original hefeweizen'. Longevity is hardly cause for celebration if the beer doesn't back it up by also being one of 'America's best' hefe weizens. It most certainly isn't that but it is a worthwhile brew if you like your wheat beers to favor the American APA side of their personalities. 2191 characters BuckeyeNation \n",

      " 3.5As with many American \"hefeweizens\" this is not really a hefeweizen. Why can't they just call it a wheat beer? It's a good wheat beer one of the better ones I've had. This absolutely is the thickest chewiest light-colored beer I've seen. Completely opaque even when held closely to light. No big visible \"floaties\" just pure unfiltered haziness. Average flavor heavy wheat as expected but highly drinkable. Although there's no strong fruit notes or any other characteristic hefe flavors I dig this.

Tastes of fruit esters and spices up front followed by a shock of hops and yeast that leaves a bitter and dry aftertaste. The full-body and low carbonation allows a smooth mouthfeel once the beer warms and the aftertaste fades. Balance and flavor seem fitting for a Hefe Weizen. A better choice than any lawnmower beer on a hot day. 515 characters PBRstreetgang \n",

      " 4An atypical Hefeweizen however I liked it. Had on tap at the local pub. Looks amazingly 'pumpkin' colored and heavily straw or golden. Pours a 1/2\" creamy head that refused to fall. Laced well as the glass empties. Smells sweetly with light banannas or papayas other sweet fruits hit like mangos and tangerines. Light bubble-gum (juicy fruit) aromas add to the sweetness. Definate hop aroma spices up the nose. Flavors of those sweet fruits are mimicked in the taste along with honey barley and wheat malt. Cooriander cloves and all-spice are detected along with flavoring hops in the body then taper into the finish. A medium yet firm body remains consistent throughout. Creamy to the finish with minor diacityl coating the palate. Finishes sweeter and less crisp than traditional Weizens but remaining hop bittering cuts the sweetness into the aftertaste. Like I said it's not true to style but I really like this beer. I have been drinking Oberon and Ayinger Brau-weiss. I'll add this one to my list. 1016 characters BEERchitect \n",

Perfectly fair.Between straw and sunset orange in color very hazy of course. Thick webby head retains well.Nose is disappointing. It's simply weak with no prominent or enticing aromas. I double checked that my bottle is fresh. Hmmm.Is this the same Widmer as from a few years ago?

      " 4I had this on tap recently while touring about Washington DC. It was served in a LARGE 32 ounce glass and without lemon. The beer is a cloudy golden and didn't seem to have as much unfiltered sediment as some other hefeweizens. The smell was weak. I detected some light yeast and wheat tones hardly any spice notes. The taste itself was also disappointing. The beer seemed a little too thin to be a true hefeweizen and sort of lacked the citrus you might expect it to have. I honestly think that this beer may have done better with a slice of lemon as the corriander and clove was really not emphasized as I thought it should be. What got me was the mouthfeel though. It lacked real carbonation which I might have tolerated had it some more yeast sediment of even light backbone. It slid down great but reminded me of a flat macro. Refreshing yes. Tasty... ?

I was actually kind of excited its rare to find a American attempt at a hefeweizen and just by the look of the bottle I thought it would be good. It stressed mightily that it was a hefeweizen. When I poured it it was a light orangish color and sort of looked like a slightly darker Konig Ludwig. The smell had definite citric scents. I got very happy thinking that this was going to be a quality beer but the taste was not what I expected. Needless to say I was upset. I am surprised that this beer has gotten such good ratings. Perhaps I expected too much but at the same time looking at my rating it seems a bit higher than I think the beer deserves. There wasn't much as far as taste. It did have the sort of lemony taste that I enjoy from many wheats but it was minimal. The body of the beer was nowhere close to other hefes. I was disappointed and if you have the choice of buying a sixer of these or spending a few more bucks to get something like a Schneider Weisse make the right choice. 1165 characters wsouloa \n",

This was also the first Hefe that I've ever had off tap. Its had a lot of hype in my area and was as expensive as decent imported beers. I was excited... and then I got the glass. This beer looked like puke. It was an odd orangish color and very cloudy. The wierdest thing about this hefe was that it had NO HEAD! Now I know that it may have been the man who poured the beer's fault but a hefe without a head is ridiculous. Its flavor was blandnot at all like a German hefe. It replaced the hefe flavor that it should of had with an alcohol taste. This beer was not worth $4.50. I say stay away from this unless you can get it for free.

      " 2.5Got this at an Albertson's grocery store in Huntington Beach. My dad informed me you could buy any beer as a single in CA. How cool is that? Anyway I did not have the luxury of a lemon in the hotel so this went in the water glass. Murky dark yellow color with thin white head and lacing. Aroma is a pretty rudimentary citrus. The flavor is a mixture of citrus malt and clove but that mixture did not really move any mountains. Finish is sweet. Not really that enjoyable. 473 characters Dogbrick \n",

      " 4.5This is one of the darker hefe's although not as dark as some. It's not on the pale end of the style anyway. Very yellowish light tan with a good wet creamy bright white head. The head wasn't as big as the one on the really good hefes. The yeast gives this beer an almost pearlescent quality. The aroma is good citrus although more organge or tangerine than lemon with nice floral/banana esters. You can smell the wheat in this one. The flavor is unusually BLAM for a hefeweizen. Schneider Weiss is huge bubblegummy esters but this is great big wheat and malt backed up with just enough esters (which I'm actually tasting as banana instead of bubblegum for once) to balance the beer out. This is also a tad bit sweeter than most in the style. 744 characters aracauna \n",

      " 4Orange with a copper cast. The frothy white head is short lived but holds a good collar and leaves some very minor lace. The aroma is slighty fruity (some light citrus) with some nice malt and a touch of spicy hop. The body is thin with a lightly creamy mouthfeel and a gentle carbonation bite on the tongue. The flavor is malty up front (slightly earthy) with a spicy hop flavor appearing towards the back of the palate and ending with a dry and spicy hoppiness that sticks around just long enough to be memorable yet refreshing. Well balanced though possibly a bit bitter - but this is from Oregon! A decent unfiltered hoppy American wheat ale. 652 characters NeroFiddled \n",

      " 3.5Sampled on tap @ 1702 Tucson; August 2011Arrives from the tap with a frothy maybe half-finger thick pale off-white colored head. The beer is a bright gold color that shows a brilliantly clear yellow gold color when held up to the light. The aroma smells of Meyer lemon zest tangerine zest a herbal backdrop and perhaps a hint of cracker like malt. The aroma is not quite as expressive as i would prefer but it does have all the com0ponents i like to see in a good IPA.The beer is light bodied and very drinkable. It finishes quite dry with a firm bitterness and a lingering ripe tangelo zest flavor as well as a touch of pale malt cracker flavor. while the body is light there is a touch of creaminess to the texture that is quite nice. There is a supporting herbal hop character here that contributes notes of pine a touch of menthol and some general not really dank herbal character.This is nice it seems a bit washed out but I think the main reason for that is the tacos I had about a half-hour ago. Still all the components are here and this is an IPA I would happily drink again. 1104 characters Gueuzedude \n",

Good retention and lacing.S - Aromatic citrus character. Not over powering like so many AIPA's out there now but noticeable and pleasant. A nice caramel malt base that blends well with the hops. Not a dominant nose and a little subdued.T/M - Very similar to the nose. Starts with the malty sweetness with the medium bitterness and hop tones blending. Again a nice citrus flavor. Well balanced no hint of alcohol. Finishes a bit dry. Full bodied with good carbonation. Lingering bitterness and citrus.O - Very easy drinking IPA. Nothing outstanding but solid in all aspects.Serving type: bottleReviewed on: 06-28-2011 12:40:40 919 characters hopfacebrew \n",

      " 412oz bottleServed in a pint glassA - It pours a brilliant amber color and is capped with three inches of off white to beige head.S - I get a good dose of grapefruit on the smell. I also get some caramel malt.T - The taste is fresh grapefruit with little bitterness. I get some of the caramel malt midway through each taste.M - MediumO - This is a refreshing IPA. The citrus taste is welcoming and the malt keeps it grounded. It is not overly bitter like a lot of west coast IPA's. This is a good everyday beer. 521 characters buschbeer \n",

A good mixture between pine floral and grassy hop. Smells rich and tasty.T-Good doses of grass and pine. Nice citrus hops too. Malt is laid back. Definitely a hop-forward beer. I enjoy the flavor. Quite bitter. The grass/floral hops are delicious.M-Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. A bit resinous. Bitter aftertaste lingers. Sharp feel.O/D-A pleasant surprise on-tap at a bar with nothing more than Bud and Coors as alternatives. A pretty good IPA. Not stunning but I was enjoying the couple glasses I had.

      " 4pours out a slightly hazed peachy colour with a thinnish head and thinnish lace. toffee malt aroma balanced nicely by some citric hops. a bit of apricot tangerine pineapple and grapefruit all have their place in the hop profile. taste buds detect first a fair amount of bitterness. malty notes come through with a touch of nougat and caramel. but back to the hops...they provide a fair amount of citrus and grassy touches. faint spruce and pine give way to more all out fruiten notes. lots of mouth puckering bitterness...bordering on blistering. IBU's must be healthy with this one. there is a bit of alcohol spice that melds well with all the hop activity. tastes good all the while giving a lot of hop flavour and delivering the bitterness. finishes on the dry side...and any residual sweetness gets buried by the bitter back end. medium-full body. hoppy coarse mouthfeel. belly and brain pleasing drinkability. overall this IPA is actually past it's prime freshness as i purchased this as part of a sampler package for summer. even though it's probably had some dubious storage it's held up well. the malt aspects of this offering are showing hints of cardboard and leather but the muscular hop profile keeps things together quite nicely. recommended. 1264 characters budgood1 \n",

The hops in the aroma are earthy in nature which compliments the grainy and earthy malt profile. I do get a big hop blast on tasting piney and harsh with some lingering citrus. Somewhat perfumey and not exactly jiving with the malt. This improves as the beer warms so I am allowing that it came from the store a bit on the cold side.This beer has a great big body and serious depth in malt and hop profiles. I get a DIPA feel to this beer and am impressed at a moderately lower ABV beer having this kind of body. Nice! 714 characters ZimZamZoom \n",

      " 3.5Ah it has been a while! After a short hiatus I am back to drinking beer. Poured into a nonic at 41 degrees. Appearance: A frothy one finger head with good retention; some lacing on the side of the glass. The color of the head is white to off white like a cloud against a clear blue sky. The color of the beer is amber to straw color with a golden yellow hue. The clarity of the beer is clear with a touch of haziness. Overall the color and the head are fairly accurate for this style of beer. Nose: The dominate aroma is hops. The hops aroma is pine grapefruit and floral bouquet. The malt in the beer is subtle but there; the aroma is grainy sweet and caramel. A note of phenols and solvent round off the aroma profile. Taste: The flavor in the beer is one dimensional the hops does not stand out. The hops flavor is floral esters pine and hint of grapefruit. The malt is grainy grassy and a note of caramel. The background flavors are phenols and solvent. The mouth feel of the beer is carbonated astringent and dry. Overall: The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium as well. This beer does not stand out as a great IPA the flavors are one dimensional and nothing in the beer stands out. An okay overall. 1244 characters colts9016 \n",

Not the typical hop-heavy standard that many critics feel necessary for approval and it is unmistakably very citrusy. this beer remains interesting enough to look forward to the next sip. This is a must try for the AIPA enthusiast who perhaps longs for a more mature and unique representation of the beer they love. this is a great addition to a hop-centric beer collection cheers. 713 characters beersheetz \n",

Tight lacing all the way around the inside.Smell consists of some light citrus hops mixed with an almost pungent sort of candied herbal smell. It's difficult to describe. Enticing though.Tastes of an herbal hop that is lightly bitter. Finish dries down fast but leaves some of those hops lingering. Not trying to offend anyone for sure. trying to stay easily within the realm of mass appeal. This keeps it from being maybe something really special though.

The taste is straight hops all the way through with subtle citrus and hop variance in the flavor. A nice beer that uses the hops well. The mouthfeel is medium a good thickness for this IPA.

This retains with a thin foaminess that flares up to a rich ½ finger leaving back a moderate looking cascade of light spotty lace.

The taste has a leafy and bitter citrus character to it that trails a herbal feel out into the mouth. This mingles with the balancing sweetness and toast of the malt (which almost has a gentle smokiness to it) to leave a rather pronounced sticky twang across the back of palate. The finish is dry with some lingering rind but it’s not coming off as overly raw or bitter. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a crisp prickle the whole way through the feel. This is undercut by some slickness that fortunately smoothes this out a bit along the back. That 6% ABV feel just about right here giving this some presence on the palate yet the alcohol is mostly staying in the background. This was OK. It wasn’t coming off to me as overly exciting to begin with and then that strange combo of herbal citric hops and smoky tang really started to come out as this warmed. I don’t know. It’s not that this was poorly crafted or anything but it’s just one of those IPAs that was a little hard to wrap the palate around. For a beer that uses Citra hops I got surprisingly little of that out of this. I’d be willing to try this again though to get a better handle on it. 1599 characters Kegatron \n",

      " 433cl brown glass bottle with standard pressure cap served into a Hard Rock cafe hefeweissbier glass in low altitude Los Angeles CA. Reviewed live.A: Pours a three finger head of nice cream good thickness and good retention. Colour is a mildly cloudy yellow-gold. Sm: Smell is a strong scent of citrus ester hops crystal hops and crystal malt. Very pleasant on a summer's day. Quite fanciful. T: Citrus ester hops are heavy - especially with regards to the dominant grapefruit which itself surfaces overwhelmingly on the finish for a nice close. The body is clean barley which does well to avoid getting in the way. I imagine they cascaded the climax but there's a problematic gap in flavour between the end of the first act and the midpoint of the beer where nothing happens. That gap throws off the otherwise sound balance. It's very very well built for an IPA - a style I usually don't like. Mf: Masterfully complements the flavour. Avoids deliberately the awful intrusive coarseness of most IPAs. Very smooth wet and refreshing. Bravo. Dr: Very drinkable well priced even as part of a variety pack and of good quality. I don't often like IPAs but this one is a real treat. 1197 characters kojevergas \n",

      " 4Poured from a 12oz brown bottle into a clear glass mug. Bottled on Apr 25 11 on front-bottom of label. Single purchased at Ancona's (Ridgefield CT) for $1.89.A: Soft peachy hue with 1-finger of off-white head with decent retention and a number of odd formations lacing. S: Citra leads the way with its citrusy yet slightly earthy oniony aroma. Pale maltiness is about evenly mixed with light caramel malts in the 20-40L range to give a kiss of caramel but more dextrins and depth.T: The flavor all in all is good but I wish they had provided more bitterness as I think it would produce a more dry crisp finish with about 10-15 more IBUs. The maltiness is light caramel and provides a reasonable backbone to the Citra hoppiness. I tasted this beer shortly after trying the Widmer Citra Summer Brew and I have to say the Citra Summer Brew has more hops flavor. I think that X-114 has the potential to be more the more drinkable of the two with more bitterness -- the other is flavorful but woudl become like flavored low-carbonated water while X-114 IPA has some bitterness to match the malts -- it just needs more IBUs to push itself firmly into the IPA realm. AS it stands it sits on the fringe and it outdone frankly by Drifter Pale Ale.M: It has a decent feel but needs a more crisp edge.O: I liked this beer but I think they could elevate it further with more bittering to provide a more crisp and focused aroma flavor and mouthfeel. 1455 characters argock \n",

Not bad; a bit paler than I'm used to for an IPA.Smell: big satisfying hop aroma. Lots of pine and grapefruit and a little bit of funk thrown in for good measure. I dig it.Taste: really good flavor. Grapefruit and tangerine round out a delicious citrusy hop character. Malt is a little bit dry and biscuity; it's not mind-blowing but it's well-formulated and well-crafted.Mouthfeel: medium body with a decent carbonation.

      " 4A: Light amber with a finger's width of foamy white head that leaves light lacing.S: Piney peachy with some light malts. Smells a little like fermented peaches. Hops are definitely the most present aroma which makes sense for an IPA.T: Some of the peachy notes come through on the flavor as well along with a hit of malts; balancing out the spicy piney hops that dominate the flavor. Despite being hit hard with the flavor of hops the bitterness is pretty temporary and the impression it leaves in my mouth is one of sweetness. A bit to much sweetness really...M: Medium bodied with a lot of carbonation. The carbonation helps it feel light even though it has a sticky almost syrupy feel to it and a lot of sweetness.O: A good beer. I like that it balances the hop bitterness with sweetness and is so much more than just a hop bomb. Easy to drink even if it coats the mouth with sweetness. 908 characters DaveBlack \n",

      " 4.5On tap at O'Reilly's Pub in Harrisburg PA on 8/11/11.A - Crystal clear light amber liquid with a golden hue and a slim bubbly white head that reduced to a patchy film and produced some spiderweb-like lacing around the glass.S - Aroma is quite dank with a hint of cat pee sweet caramel malt and faint bready notes as well as mild skunk and citrus fruit. Smells like a hippie that just pissed his pants... but in a good way if you can possibly imagine a urine character as a \"good thing\". T - Sweet but juicy and dank with a touch of cat pee among the leafy green tea-like (or herb-like) hops. Sweet caramel malt balances the hops quite a bit. This isn't an overly bitter IPA mind you but the hop character is bold and unrelenting. M - Light bodied with a faily oily texture and modest carbonation. Bitterness doesn't linger very long on the palate at all. Instead the finish is somewhat bittersweet and is rather kind to the palate.D - I really enjoyed this one surprisingly. Gotta love those dank-ass IPAs. Here is another one to add to the list! X-114 boasts a lot of hop character without the intense palate-wrecking bitterness. 1148 characters ffejherb \n",

      " 3.5Smooth tropical sweetness assisted by thin caramel flavor give both balance and complexity to this single hopped ale.X-114 pours a bright light copper with an orange tint. Medium haze provides a testament to late addition hops. A head of medium froath egg shell white and light lace provide an appealing look to the eye.Balanced to the nose caramel sweetness citrus notes light grasses and an odd vegetal quality makes for a varying and sweeter IPA than is usual; seemingly of a Double IPA except with lower body and power.Avoiding the notion that IPAs are a showcase for hops the balanced flavor includes a burst of caramel flavor and light sugary sweetness. But the flavors of ruby red grapefruit pulp tangerines freshly cut grasses and an odd fresh green tobacco flavor contribute waves of flavors one after the other. The sweet caramel taste seems to provide a sticky resiny and pungent flavor that's not normally associated with the Citra hop variety.Medium-full mouthfeel brings about an early creamy texture until the carbonation fades. Fuller sweetness than usual allows for a longer transition into bitterness dryness and crispness than is expected from IPAs. As carbonation subsides late the beer's semi-dry alcohol warmth and medium crispness takes hold but without relinquishing full control of malty sweetness.Satisfying enough this IPA is much more moderate and balanced than preferred. The Citra hops are portrayed in a meek manner and is largely hidden by caramel sweetness in flavor and feel. If the beer had a crisper better attenuated malt character and pronounced Citra bitterness flavor and aroma then this beer could be a real showcase for the Citra hop variety. 1717 characters BEERchitect \n",

      " 4.5Pours into a chalice with a beautiful copper semi chill hazed clarity forms a thicket of chunky beige lacing that forms lace all the way around the sides of the glass. Aroma has a big citrus bite with tropical fruit tartness a hint of mango/pineapple action really stands out just smells really West coast to the nose. Earthy herbal citrus rind with a hint of dank kind bud. Really nice hops going on here interesting as a beer from Kroger in Martins Ferry OH will ever get so far. Flavor surprises me a again with a big juicy luscious hop character seems vine ripened super fresh must be those Citra hops popping in every direction. Honestly for the value of a beer this nice at $8.99 a six I may have just found one of the best beers of 2011. Not overly bitter but in your face citrus/pineapple/mango blended with a mildly dank earthy herbaceous hop character. Semi sweet malts blend out a nice balance in this beer well done from every angle no complaints only praise. Mouthfeel another highlight no cloying sweetness from residual sugars this one finished bone dry with a assertive lively carbonation that doesn't over do it. No heavy booze going on to burn you either only around 6.2% abv.Overall one of the most likeable drinking IPAs around right now I'm a believer that the Widmer Brothers aren't joking around after tasting this beer. Their hefeweizen which was wildly popular while I was living in the So Cal confused me but I understand how it has caught on. I will be driving back down for more of this quality IPA without a doubt. 1561 characters WVbeergeek \n",

      " 2It's an IPA pours a tall white head with an off orange body. There is excellent clarity though virtually head looking body no carbonation or anything. Not much going on here. Citrus notes without the sharp hot hop bites I so love. The malt isn't really jumping out. It has a nice sweet aroma but it is far in the back. No grain or anything else that really stands out. I can't find the right words for this one. There's a pear/mango like fruity flavor here with a dry hop finish that bites decently. None of that intense citrus american hop bite. The malt has an off like flavor that I'm not sure how to describe here. It just isn't for me.The beer looks flat once the head dies but it is well carbonated. The beer has a very nice light medium body that I'm finding rather refreshing. it seems a hair thicker than the abv should be but no worries.I'm not sure what I think about this one. This isn't \"x\" awesome as it implies but it's reasonably priced and pretty decent stuff. There are a million IPAs out there and this isn't the best or even best for the money. 1079 characters bobhits \n",

      " 3.512oz. bottle served in a tulip at 53 degrees. Bottled on April 22 2011. Pours a dull orange with a semi-hazy clarity and a quarter inch loose cream-colored head that quickly disperses towards the shoulders leaving a frothy band around the edges and a soapy slick across the center. Nose expresses citrus - not quite sweet but not bitter either. There's also an herbal/rind-like quality. Taste follows nose but more bitter/herbal and less sweet and citrusy than anticipated. There's also a light citric acid bitterness that lingers between quaffs as well as a faint ethanol character. Mouthfeel is medium-light (but closer to light) with a prickly carbonation and a slight astringency with a trace of heat at the finish; surprising given the abv. Overall not a bad beer - it lacks a bit of balance and the carbonation throws it off a little but I certainly wouldn't pass one up if offered. 893 characters Jwale73 \n",

Cheers!Appearance – Pours into my tulip with a clear orange color and about a finger of white head that dissipates quickly.Smell – To be honest overall muted. Slight citrus pine and floral hops. A nice caramel malt backbone emerges as the beer warms.Taste – A nice fresh citrus burst up front followed by floral hops and slight pine. There is a definite sweet malty backbone but it does not take over the slightly bitter hops. I would prefer for there to be a bit more hop/bitterness however as stated there is not an overpowering malt backbone which is important.Mouthfeel – Medium bodied decent carbonation.Overall – Yet another tasty quaffable IPA I’ve had the pleasure of having in the past two nights.

Getting malt tasting of dry white bread. Not too exciting.M ~ A touch thin for an IPA to be honest with a touch of bitter to make everything not too unbearable. Becomes hard to drink halfway through though.D ~ Chuggable yet very mild IPA. I guess the low ABV/Pricetag makes it a great session beer but I probably would just rather buy something else.

      " 3.5Appearance has a lighter than most IPA's a golden color with a thin easily dissapating head leaving spotty lace. Smell of floral citric piney hops with sweet malt in the back. Taste of nugget hops? maybe having a piney resiny note that blends fairly well with the malt. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation. Not my first choice in a IPA but not bad. 359 characters Bookseeb \n",

      " 4Poured from a longneck 12 oz. brown bottle into a standard clear pint glass.Appearance: Clear deep golden color with a one finger fluffy white head that leaves good lacing.Smell: Citrus and grassy with a little musty hemp-like aroma. Interesting.Taste: This is all about the hops very fresh and clean tasting pine and hemp-like hops. Has very little pale malt underneath certainly not enough to balance. But not overly bitter either. This has an unusual very hoppy taste due to the lack of balance but I sort of like it. It gives it a more unique hops profile than most American IPA's. Mouth feel: Very thin and light with good carbonation. A very crisp feel on the tongue. Drinkability: I like this one due to it's unique hops profile and lack of malt balance. It's all about the hops and sometimes I am in the mood for that. I like this original flavored IPA and would drink it again. Would like to try it on tap some day. 942 characters ChopperSmith \n",

      " 3.5This beer pours a clear pale golden color with a finger of foamy white head that laces well and retains ok. The aroma is brilliant and strong with citrusy hops note from the citra hops but not much else. The taste starts with a lot of citrusy hop bitterness and maybe a little bready malt at the end. Was kind of hoping there would be a little more complexity to the flavor on the malt end... it's basically a lot of bitter. The mouthfeel is nice and balanced but finishes with a lingering bitterness. Overall a pretty good IPA. 531 characters csiewert \n",

      " 4.5The beer pours a glowing orange-yellow in color with a small creamy white head that leaves sticky lacing of medium thickness down the glass. The aroma is an aromatic ambrosia of tropical fruits and citrus zests. The taste is wonderful massive fruity hops a delicous combination of several tropical fruits and citrus. The citrus component is all the fruit and aromatics and none of the bitterness. That is not to say that all these hops don't impart a dry and bitter finish it is just that the fruit sits apart and on top of any bitter notes. This IPA is hophead's dream. I know my rating is higher than most others for this beer but I absolutely loved it. 667 characters cpolking \n",

      " 4Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint.This one pours a just slightly hazy orange color with a decent head. Aroma has a nice well-rounded level of hoppiness. Citrus floral pines it's all here. The taste here is very interesting it's got a very unique flavor profile for an IPA. It's fairly subtle on the hops; however the malt presence is very weak. Therefore the subtle well-rounded hops are the star of the show. And they really are quite unique they have a little bit of everything all rolled into one. There's citrus floral pine and just a bit of herbal aspects here. That said it all comes out being just a bit weak unfortunately.The mouthfeel is nice enough it's got a decently substantial body and a moderate level of carbonation and the drinkability is fairly good. Overall an interesting IPA but not one likely to make it's way into my rotation. 893 characters shand \n",

The beer had just a thin cap of white head that low retention and light lacing.The aroma had very nice pine and floral hop scents and just a hint of malt graniness. Sadly those nice scents didn't really transfer over to the flavors. There was some pine but mostly just bitter hop flavors. The bitterness really lingered for a long time on the finish.The body was on the thin side of average for the style. Drinkability was OK but I wouldn't want 2 of these in a row. Overall a decent but uninteresting beer. If you skip this one you won't really miss anything. 718 characters beertunes \n",

      " 4Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Bottled on date of 4/22/11 on bottom of front label. It was a slightly hazy golden honey color with good carb streams. Had an average sized head that quickly settled into a collar and some wisps. Moderate quick sliding foam with none sticking. The aroma was cirtric hops along with a caramel malt base. Good but wish the hops were more present. The taste starts with the sweet malt and then a slow build of low bitter hops. Pretty well balanced between the two but also neither gets very high on its own so its subdued overall. Good but not exciting either. Full mouthfeel with good carb and a slightly bitter aftertaste.Overall a good solid middle of the road IPA. Gets the job done and has good flavor but doesn't have me wanting to go out and buy more of it. Avail here in TX. Rotation - not six pack worthy but maybe an occasional spot in the IPA mixed 6 pack.

A - The beer looks great... it is so clear it's almost unnatural but it's pretty to look at. pours a solid head and leaves a good lacing down the glass. It'd be damn hard for a beer to look much better than this. S - Smells great grapefruity a tiny bit of pungent or grassy hops with maybe a melon or some other fruit that I can't pick up that well. Not an overwhelming nose on this beer but what is there compliments the taste really well. T - A very good IPA from Widmer. Recently I'm pretty glad to see them doing some beers other than an amber or their famous hefe. Really has a solid type of bitterness to this beer with a smooth mouthfeel and a good amount of hop aftertaste. Very very sessionable. M - Solid smooth mouthfeel on this beer.. this could easily be a 4.5. Has a sweetness to it but finishes dry enough to not be cloying and still seems to have a bit of body to it (not too dry). Certainly not crazy malty in any way but what is there supports the hops pretty perfectly. Overall - A very good IPA from Widmer. I'm happy to see them making some new beers recently and there seem to be a number of them floating around the Portland OR area.. Kudos. 1250 characters alamere \n",

The taste is dominated by bitter hops. Rather than a sweet malty complexity there is a cereal graininess that adds a nice non-syrupy complexity. Again the craft of this beer disallows any harsh imperfections that you might experience with a small time brewery. The body is medium and smooth and the aftertaste is rounds out and is devoid of that “dirty” bitterness. 565 characters beerdown77 \n",

The smell while not overwhelming is very pleasant and flowery. Nice floral hop notes that are backed by a wheaty malt. I almost smell rhodedendron flowers even? Just throwing that out there. Clean and concise and very solid. No off-flavors in the taste. Fairly straight-forward and simple sticking to some very flavorful floral hops that finish in a dry and crisp mouthfeel. Goes down easy and clean for an IPA. Amazingly refreshing after a long day and all-in-all just a very good classic example of an American IPA. I could see this being a sort of go-to beer especially at 8.99 a sixer. Easy to drink yet very flavorful. Good introduction to Widmer for me. 813 characters Rschis16 \n",

Lace is minimal.S - The nose is a very mild blend of herbal and floral notes with maybe a little grassiness underlying. It is not terrible but not particularly good either.T - This beer is almost two months old at this point so I am not expecting an extravgant hop bouquet but it shouldn't taste like THIS. Some basic malt notes that taste stale and sweaty and herbal notes make for a trainwreck which could not have been much better when super-fresh.M - The feel is like an average IPA nothing special nothing bad.O - This is not a very good beer. 664 characters ktrillionaire \n",

      " 412 oz bottle poured from a 6 pack I picked up at the local BevMo. Bottle date April 12 2011. Served in a Peroni Pilsner glass.Pours a very nice clean light gold thick white frothy head that dissipates after a few minutes leaving behind above average lacing. Looks great!One sniff and you know this has some serious Citra hops in it. tangerine grapefruit pineapple slight lemon zest; there is also some nice grassiness and pine resin going on (cascade maybe?). Mellow malt sweetness is present but subtle.I love the way this tastes! Juicy citrus and pineapple are cut through by some bitter grapefruit peel and fresh green resiny astringency. This really showcases a great hop presence. Not balanced (in a good way)...all hop with a mild sweetness on the mid palate. At only 6.2% ABV this is very drinkable!Medium bodied and coats the mouth nicely. Hop bitterness lingers in the mouth well after drinking this beer. My only knock is that I would like to see a little more carbonation (just a personal preference on hop forward IPAs...more refreshing).Overall I really enjoy this beer. It will definitely satisfy hop heads looking for an IPA that isn't pushing 7%. Showcases the Citra hop nicely without going over the top on the tropical notes. Having recently tried this and Nelson from Widmer I am very impressed with the new line of IPA's they have released. Well done! 1387 characters BeerOnTheWall \n",

      " 4.5If I had to live anywhere else in these United States other than my native San Francisco Bay Area it would have to be Portland Oregon and beers like this one are exactly why.Quickly turning into my early summer favorite home at the shack this Citra-fired hop bomblet pours a style-perfect yellow-gold with a tight inch-deep snow white head that shows decent retention and throws quite a bit of lacing.Given that the X-114 was designed as a Citra delivery system it succeeds in its mission quite well; delicate florals—as well as a veritable holiday fruit basket full of citrus—inherent in that variety come though intact give the beer a sweetness that balances the bittering aspects of the hybrid hop. X-114 gives up hints of lemon pineapple and tangerine as it warms.The malt foundation too helps to prop up this very balanced surprisingly refreshing introduction to the summer drinking season. As the second offering in the Rotator IPA Series is scheduled to drop during the summer I for one intend to put a dent in this stock while I can. 1065 characters monkeylovebeer \n",

Sweetness and a little toasted flavor really help to bring some balance while letting the hops shine.Smooth with some solid carbonation.

      " 4.5I still had to give this a try even though the last couple IPAs I have had from Widmer have been disappointing.This one pours a very clear and relatively light golden color with white cap that doesn't last too long but leaves a little lace.I like the fresh abundant hoppy aroma! Nice citrus fruit like lemon mandarin and just a bit of sweet pineapple. It has an herbal note as well. Not much of the malts to smell until it warms up then just getting a whiff of lightly toasted caramel malts.Flavors show off the excellent hops mostly sweet citrus. Straight out of the fridge it's pretty tasty. It's rare but I think I like this beer colder than after it's warmed a bit. With warmth the hops mellow out and more of the sweet toasted malts come out. They're good but not the strong point of this IPA.Feel is medium light with moderate carbonation. This is a refreshing beer hopefully they'll keep it around for the summer. Nice work Widmer! Redeemed themselves after a big time dud with Deadlift and the only so-so Nelson DIPA. It's been a while since I've had Halo but if my memory serves me Widmer would do well to replace Halo with this beer as their permanent release IPA. 1197 characters josiahschlender \n",

      " 2.5Sure it took me a while. Thought the bottle just said 'rotator' on it. Like you're rotating the beer and so forth. Alas it settled in in the end. Pours a clear golden straw. A bit unexciting yet decent nonetheless. Light notes of citrus on the nose are pleasant yet quite APA in order. Pleasant enough but coming up a bit short for the style. Offers a rather slight bitterness above and beyond the standard pale ale and just a touch of hop spice.So this is what an IPA has come to eh? I think not...In the end a spiced pale ale with a light body smooth yet lacking in bitterness. And in fact this seems to be a slight variant of their Drifter Pale. 656 characters HalfFull \n",

S: A full-on load of hops on the nose. Floral up front with loads of grapefruit and lemon peel along with a hint of cannabis. Malt rounds it off with sweet bready aromas in the background. T: Fruity spicy hop flavors consisting of herbal citrusy notes along with undertones of unripe apple. Malt balances this beer out nicely although it's prescence is dominated by hops. Notes: Of the brews I have had from Widmer this one might be my favorite they have to offer. Medium bodied and loaded with flavor this is just the type of IPA I like to seek out. Its got the flavor of a double IPA without the body and ABV. Well done! 815 characters WYVYRN527 \n",

      " 3.5Picked this up for the Citra hops probably would have passed otherwise. 12 oz bottle with a bottled on date of Apr 13 11. Pours a hazed gold color with ample off-white head. Lacing is spectacular with this beer.Tropical and citric hop aroma. Light and grainy malts in the background. Nose does not disappoint with citra goodness abound.Taste shows some good hop components both bittering and flavor. Malts stay light and airy not much interplay between the two. Yeast is clean and smooth. It comes off a little basic with the flavors going straight from hop flavor to grainy malt to light bitter finish robotically. I like it crisp and clean...but after a few commercial examples and 3 or 4 homebrew experiments it seems like Citra needs a little help from some friends. Maybe some Amarillo and Cascade could help improve the depth. Light touch of caramel malt might not hurt either. Still though I glided through my six-pack with ease and would drink some more without complaint. 990 characters twiggamortis420 \n",

The body is a dark orange little hints of yellow here and there slightly transparent  but still a little cloudy. Overall a pretty dang good look head is good body is good. The smell is great it smells powerful hoppy and big! Subtle malt smell in there too very very citrucy and maybe a floral note as well. The smell is really excellent Widmer has a pretty one sided hop affair but for this beer it's just perfect. The taste isn't as balanced as I would like because there is very little malt but on the other hand too much malt is a problem in some IPA's and there is for sure enough hops this is a hop hound for sure! For sure some hidden flavors in here as well not sure exactly what possibly floral and/or earthy. For sure a little citrucy but the citrus is overpowered by the huge hop flavor. I can't get down on this beer for being too hoppy it's really impressive because it's one of the hoppiest beers I've had in at least a few months and that's including Stone's Ruination IPA. It could have better balance to it but it's impressive none the less how much hops they packed in here. Mouthfeel is very good carbonation and thickness are both very nice. Drinkability is a little low but that's only because it's so damn bitter! Overall a very good IPA not too well balanced but if your in the mood for hops there aren't too many beers that are going to deliver better than this beer. 1594 characters MaltsOfGlory \n",

Even bottled stamped about 6 weeks old it's a tasty brew that I'm enjoying by the cheap six pack price as long as it's in rotation.

      " 2.5A&S - Pale straw yellow fizzy slim head mostly some sweet citrus hops on the nose.T&M - Very fizzy and bright on the front with the slightest pale malt turns very bitter then a little citrus with more hop bite on the end.O - Bad batch?Got this in the Widmer Brother's Best Variety Pack which so far is 2:2. Im not sure if this was a bad batch but I cannot find any flavor in this beer. It tastes like hop water. The balance is totally off theres this straw flavored malt that is no where near enough to make up for the bitterness of the hops. Don't see a reason for me or anyone else to buy this again. Sorry if your offended i'll be sure to update if a better bottle is drank. Stay thirsty my friends. 714 characters NickRivers \n",

      " 3.5Pleasant crisp hoppy beer.Nice piney scent. Attractive amber color. Light body. Grapefruit is the fruit that comes to mind with some bitter peel. Just a hint of sweetness along with pale malt taste. Hops quite aggressive. Long bitter aftertaste but not offensive. Very thin and sharp but some mellow malt flavors come through. I think the first gulp was the best and it is less appealing after half a glass. 415 characters mactrail \n",

I'll be grabbing a couple 6 packs of this to enjoy. easy to drink with a fairly smooth mouthfeel. not quite carbonated the way I would preferoverall its pretty good not amazing but definitely pretty tasty. 612 characters psiweaver \n",

      " 4Poured this into my coke glass where is yielded a 1 finger thick foamy white head.retention is pretty good evenAfter a few sips is is still a thick film with splotchy big bubbles. Looks transparent golden color with carbonation visible. Smell is of grapefruit and citrus. Taste reinforces the grapefruit there is also some pine flavors that come a little farther back in the sip. Finish is nicely bitter. Mouthfeel isn't really noticeable which means it's good after a couple sips really testing the mouthfeel I think it's just a touch thick but didn't notice it without looking or it. I will admit to being a sucker for a citrus IPA so personally I have to say that I enjoy it but I think that it is still a good beer even without my bias. Considering I paid $7 for a 6-er of this it was definitely worth it. I truly hope this one comes back around sometime. 868 characters gkunkle \n",

I am a little surprised only because I don't remember this when I had it at the Gausthouse. I remember an aroma that was not this prominent. Taste- Pure grapefruit. Some more citrus and pine in the back. Lots of bitterness at the very end of the swallow. The bitterness and malt flavor grow as it gets warm. Mouthfeel - Good for the style. Gets a little thicker as the beer warms. Overall- Good drinking beer. Glad they put this in bottles. I have been waiting for this Rotator IPA series.

      " 3.5-Appearance: (4.0)Very clear light caramel colored brew like a light amber. Thick three fingers of foam down to a splatter of lace and velvet foam. The best part of the appearance is the head with this number.-Smell: (4.0)A wonderful roasted malt scent rests nicely with a caramel malt. Big zesty bright hops citrus grapefruit orange peel and some grassy notes. Hidden tang of lemon zest. The hop profile really spreads far from the top of the glass.-Taste: (3.5)Smooth bready and roasted caramel malt with a light 'Drifter-like' approach. Zingy bitter hops with a touch of earthy grass and citrus peel. Overall really not too robust of a flavor but rather mild. -Mouthfeel: (3.5)Light bodied with a drying effect from the bitterness. Leaves a bit of a chalky feel behind.. makes me thing of dry barley husks. -Overall: (3.5)This beers highlights are with how smooth and drinkable it is. It is actually quite light and the hops are certainly a focal point. This is a great and refreshing session ale from Widmer. A a year around I don't know if it would do so well but as part of a Rotator series.. I am sure it will be some peoples favorite. 1164 characters Docer \n",

      " 4I have been slightly disappointed with most Widmer products with the exception of Brrr! and Drifter. I'm a big IPA fan and look forward to trying anything new (especially from West Coast breweries).This was excellent! For starters it has an outstanding citrus nose that immediately hooks you in. The smell is followed by the wonderful flavors of it's bold combination of hops. It's very easy to drink and at 6% it won't knock you out like some of the 7%-9% other IPAs. I found it on sale for $7.99/six pack which is an outstanding buy compared to similar products for $9/$11.Note --- Widmer beers need to be served in a glass. You do not get the full experience of the beer within the bottle. The tiny head on the bottles don't seem to allow enough oxygen in to release the smell and flavor.Great job Widmer!

      " 3On tap poured into a plastic cup beer had minimal soapy head right at the surface on the pour showing a darker golden yellow beer clear with some good carbonation. Not too much lacing. Light pine needles some feint grapefruit pith in there as well. Very light aroma though without much malt on the nose.Taking a sip decent bitter pine initially but finishes rather cleanly and crisply. Not much of a malt backbone to this IPA as there's barely any body or sweetness to the beer. Very well carbonated with some prickly bubbles that really keep the tongue clean and contributes to the crispness of the finish.Not terribly exciting as an IPA but pretty easy to drink and went well with the bratwurst I drank it with. 727 characters nataku00 \n",

      " 4.5I had this one on tap at their Gasthaus in Portland. What a great place & I was happy to see a Black IPA on tap!I guess the 114 is an experimental hop variety.Served in a standard pint the beer is jet black and opaque with a smallish tan head.The nose is peppery with pine and lightly toasted cracker in the background. Given the color you would expect lots of roasted malts; instead you get a blast of hoppy goodness. The hops are prominent and are a combo of spicy (white pepper) and piney. The beer has soft apple notes in the finish.The mouth has sharp carbonation and is a bit rough in the best way.Very easy drinker and a different take on the standard IPA. I like this one!note after reading the other reviews this may be a new take on the beer. 769 characters Redrover \n",

      " 3.5Found on tap at Gasthaus. Brewed at their Rose Garden facility and not the mammoth system across the street. The name X-114 comes from the name of the experimental hop used in the brew. The hop is from New Zealand according to our waiter but he wasn't aware of it's lineage (but took the geeky question very well). Good marks for the hop character aroma is very citrusy orange and grapefruit; delivered flavor is similar. The beer itself stutters though due to excessive over filtration a common characteristic in Widmer brews large and small (sans the hef for obvious reasons). The X-114 hop is nice though and will go on to make some great IPAs if it ever makes to market and gets a real name! 702 characters deeplennon \n",
